        This spec is incomplete and it is not expected that it will advance
        beyond draft status. Authors should not use most of these features
        directly, but instead use JavaScript editing libraries. The features
        described in this document are not implemented consistently or fully by
        user agents, and it is not expected that this will change in the
        foreseeable future. There is currently no alternative to some
        execCommand actions related to clipboard content and
        contentEditable=true is often used to draw the caret and move the caret
        in the block direction as well as a few minor subpoints. This spec is
        to meant to help implementations in standardizing these existing
        features. It is predicted that in the future both specs will be
        replaced by <a href="https://w3c.github.io/contentEditable/">Content Editable</a> and
        <a href="https://w3c.github.io/input-events/">Input Events</a>.

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The APIs specified here were originally introduced in Microsoft's
        Internet Explorer, but have subsequently been copied by other browsers
        in a haphazard and imprecise fashion. Although the behavior specified
        here does not exactly match any browser at the time of writing, it can
        serve as a target to converge to in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the reasoning behind the specification is of interest, such as
        when major preexisting rendering engines are known not to match it, the
        reasoning is available by clicking the "comments" button on the right
        (requires JavaScript). If you have questions about why the
        specification says something, check the comments first. They're
        sometimes longer than the specification text itself, and commonly
        record what the major browsers do and other essential information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The principles used for writing this reference list are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If all browsers that implement a particular feature agree on some
        detail of how it works, match them unless there's very good reason not
        to. When it's not clear what behavior is best, try to follow the
        implementations with the most market share. But if one browser's
        behavior is clearly better than the others', go with the better
        behavior.
        </li>
        <li>If a command is issued to format some text in a particular way, we
        will format the text that way no matter what. If the user clicks the
        "bold" button, they don't care that the text didn't become bold because
        of an external CSS rule or for any other reason, they only care that it
        didn't work. The only exception (beyond where it's simply impossible,
        like propagated text-decorations we can't remove) is that we don't try
        to override !important rules from external stylesheets, although we
        also don't go out of our way to respect them.
        </li>
        <li>When we're given a presentational command like "bold", don't modify
        anything other than presentational markup related to that command. If
        an element has non-presentational attributes like id or class, don't
        split it up or remove it or anything. At most convert it to a span, if
        it's some type of presentational element. ("Presentational" here really
        means "browsers produce it in response to execCommand() so we need to
        treat it as presentational", so it includes things like [^strong^] and
        [^em^].) Of course, in some cases we have to remove elements, like when
        merging two blocks.
        </li>
        <li>Don't interfere with more markup than necessary. If the user
        modifies only a small run of text, don't go around simplifying
        ancestors or siblings or whatever unless it's necessary to produce
        simpler markup in the place that was actually modified.
        </li>
        <li>But if we are already changing around something's style, convert
        existing styles to the preferred format. For instance, we use
        <code title="">&lt;b&gt;</code> for bold (if the CSS styling flag is
        false), and convert <code title="">&lt;strong&gt;</code> and
        <code title="">&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;</code> if we
        happen to be modifying that node anyway.
        </li>
        <li>Try not to make the document less conforming than it originally
        was. If we happen to make it more conforming, good, although we don't
        have to go out of our way to do that. In some cases we do make the
        document less conforming, generally because there's some clear use-case
        that requires it or because it matches existing browsers behavior. (For
        instance, see the styleWithCSS = false mode, and the fact that
        insertImage doesn't add an alt attribute, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>Keep the markup as concise as possible. (I've received feedback
        that this is very important to authors.) Ideally, the markup should
        look as simple and neat as what a human would have produced by
        hand-editing. We do complicated manipulation to pull styles down from
        ancestors rather than having to use inline CSS, and make sure to tidy
        up any styles on elements that we happen to be modifying anyway.
        Previous principles take precedence over this one, however.

        Issues
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification is mostly feature-complete. It should be considered
        mostly stable and awaiting implementater review and feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        Significant known issues that I need feedback on, or otherwise am not
        planning to fix just yet:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Need to make CSS terminology more precise, about setting/unsetting
        CSS properties. The intent is to modify the style attribute,
        CSSOM-style. Suggestions appreciated on how I should spec this.
        </li>
        <li>I use <a href=
        "http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#resolved-value">resolved value</a>
        instead of computed or used or anything like that, just because that's
        what my test implementation uses (via getComputedStyle). This is not
        necessarily the best actual choice: if it should be something else,
        please tell me.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I haven't paid much attention to performance. The algorithms here
            aren't performance-critical in most cases, but I might have
            accidentally included some algorithms that are too slow anyway on
            large pages. Generally I haven't worried about throwing nodes away
            and recreating them multiple times or things like that, as long as
            it produces the correct result.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it would be useful to implementers for me to spend time and spec
            complexity on avoiding some of the masses of useless operations
            that are currently required, please say so. All intermediate DOM
            states are black-box detectable via mutation events or whatever
            their replacement will be, so implementers theoretically can't
            optimize most of this stuff too much themselves, but in practice I
            doubt anyone will rely on the intermediate DOM states much.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>[^br^]s are a nightmare. I have tons of hacks all over the place
        which are totally wrong, mostly to account for the fact that sometimes
        [^br^]s do nothing and we need to treat that case magically. I don't
        know what a good way is to fix this. At this point I've mostly gotten
        the evil concentrated in the definitions "collapsed line break",
        "extraneous line break", and "collapsed block prop", but there's lots
        of other special-case handling scattered about. Feedback appreciated.
        How do browsers handle this?
        </li>
        <li>The CSS styling flag is an issue. Currently authors are forced to
        turn it entirely on or entirely off. If it's on, it produces stuff like
        <code title="">&lt;span style=font-weight:bold&gt;</code> instead of
        <code title="">&lt;b&gt;</code>, while if it's off, it produces stuff
        like <code title="">&lt;font color=red&gt;</code> instead of
        <code title="">&lt;span style=color:red&gt;</code>. The issue is that
        authors might want a mix, like making the markup as concise as possible
        while still conforming, and they can't do that. Changing the flag on a
        per-command basis doesn't help because of things like the "restore the
        values" algorithm, which might create several different types of style
        at once and has to use the same styling flag for all of them. This was
        discussed back in March in <a href=
        "http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-March/030714.html">
          this thread</a>, along with a number of other things, but at that
          time I hadn't written commands that change multiple styles at once,
          so it seemed feasible to ask authors to switch styleWithCSS on or off
          on a per-command basis.
        </li>
        <li>I haven't defined the "undo" or "redo" commands yet. They look very
        complicated to define precisely, and other people are working on them
        right now.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="XXX">
        A variety of other issues are also noted in the text, formatted like
        this. Feedback would be appreciated on all of them.

        <p>
          TODO:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scour browser bug trackers to try spotting issues I haven't
          thought of.
          </li>
          <li>The wording I use for DOM stuff is not maximally precise. Really
          I want DOM Core to define nice concepts that I can xref, like "insert
          a node". I don't want to have to explicitly refer to DOM methods like
          insertBefore() every time I want to move things.
          </li>
          <li>JavaScript can modify the DOM synchronously in some cases, such
          as DOM mutation events and onunload when moving around iframes and
          objects. This has to be dealt with somehow. (Pointed out by Ryosuke
          Niwa of WebKit: <a href=
          "http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-March/030730.html">
            1</a> <a href=
            "http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-March/030751.html">
            2</a>)
          </li>
          <li>What happens if you do something like delete a selection or
          insert text or whatnot in the middle of a surrogate pair? This could
          make the content not serialize through a character encoding change.
          </li>
          <li>Some more thought needs to go into what happens to the selection
          when you mutate the DOM. In some cases the results are pretty
          arbitrary. It might make sense to do some kind of normalization.
          </li>
          <li>I'm sloppy about handling things like nodes that don't descend
          from a Document, comments that are children of a Document, that sort
          of thing. Not essential for prototyping, but needs to be cleaned up
          eventually. Mostly we should be able to avoid the problems by
          requiring that everything be editable, since that immediately means
          it has to descend from an element or Document (and cannot be
          parentless itself).
          </li>
          <li>I need to pay more attention to invisible nodes. These will have
          no visual effect, but they'll make many algorithms behave
          differently: decomposing a range, block-extending, etc. Also, need to
          improve the definition to include things like whitespace-only nodes.
          </li>
          <li>Have to make sure that in all the places where we set a
          selection, it's valid.
          </li>
          <li>Redefine things in terms of ranges, not selections.
          </li>
          <li>Allow some type of switch to affect non-editable regions too,
          perhaps on a per-command basis.
          </li>
          <li>Things like delete, forwardDelete, insertText need to handle
          non-BMP characters.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Also TODO: Things that are only implemented by a couple of browsers
          and may or may not be useful to spec:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>decreaseFontSize, increaseFontSize: Only implemented in Gecko and
          Opera.
          </li>
          <li>contentReadOnly, enableInlineTableEditing, enableObjectResizing,
          heading, insertBrOnReturn: MDC docs say not implemented in IE (didn't
          test).
          </li>
          <li>readOnly: MDC docs say it's a deprecated equivalent of
          contentReadOnly, so presumably like useCSS but less popular.
          </li>
          <li>2D-Position, absolutePosition, clearAuthenticationCache,
          createBookmark, insertButton, insertFieldset, insertIframe,
          insertInput*, insertMarquee, insertSelectDropdown,
          insertSelectListbox, insertTextarea, liveResize, multipleSelection,
          overwrite, print, refresh, saveAs, unbookmark: Mentioned in MSDN docs
          but not MDC, so presumably IE-only. Some of these seem inappropriate
          or useless, others will bear investigation.
          </li>
          <li>findString, fontSizeDelta, insertNewlineInQuotedContent,
          justifyNone, print, transpose: There's code for these in WebKit,
          Source/WebCore/editing/EditorCommand.cpp, but I didn't see them
          mentioned elsewhere. Some might be worth adding.
          </li>
          <li>unselect: Seems to not be implemented by Gecko or Opera, and IE
          behaves oddly: it seems to collapse the selection instead of removing
          it. Will only implement if there seems to be demand; it's redundant
          to Selection.removeAllRanges() anyway.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Things I haven't looked at that multiple browsers implement:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>redo, undo: Needs review of the Google work on this; will
          probably be quite complicated.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Also need to look at contenteditable=plaintext-only.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Things that would be useful to address for the future but aren't
        important to fix right now are in comments prefixed with "TODO".

          This specification defines a number of <dfn id="command" title=
          "command">commands</dfn>, identified by <a class="external"
          data-anolis-spec="domcore" href=
          "http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive">ASCII
          case-insensitive</a> strings. Each <a href="#command">command</a> can
          have several pieces of data associated with it:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <dfn id="action">Action</dfn>: What the <a href=
            "#command">command</a> does when executed via <code><a href=
            "#execcommand()">execCommand()</a></code>. Every <a href=
            "#command">command</a> defined in this specification has an
            <a href="#action">action</a> defined for it in the relevant
            section. For example, <a href="#the-bold-command">the <code title=
            "">bold</code> command</a>'s <a href="#action">action</a> generally
            makes the current selection bold, or removes bold if the selection
            is already bold. An editing toolbar might provide buttons that
            execute the <a href="#action">action</a> for a <a href=
            "#command">command</a> if clicked, or a script might run an
            <a href="#action">action</a> without user interaction to achieve
            some particular effect. Actions return either true or false, which
            can affect the return value of <code><a href=
            "#execcommand()">execCommand()</a></code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn id="indeterminate">Indeterminate</dfn>: A boolean value
            returned by <code><a href=
            "#querycommandindeterm()">queryCommandIndeterm()</a></code>,
            depending on the current state of the document. Generally, a
            <a href="#command">command</a> that has a <a href=
            "#state">state</a> defined will be <a href=
            "#indeterminate">indeterminate</a> if the <a href=
            "#state">state</a> is true for part but not all of the current
            selection, and a <a href="#command">command</a> that has a <a href=
            "#value">value</a> defined will be <a href=
            "#indeterminate">indeterminate</a> if different parts of the
            selection have different <a href="#value" title="value">values</a>.
            An editing toolbar might display a button or control in a special
            way if the <a href="#command">command</a> is <a href=
            "#indeterminate">indeterminate</a>, like showing a "bold" button as
            partially depressed, or leaving a font size selector blank instead
            of showing the font size of the current selection. As a rule, a
            <a href="#command">command</a> can only be <a href=
            "#indeterminate">indeterminate</a> if its <a href=
            "#state">state</a> is false, supposing it has a <a href=
            "#state">state</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn id="state">State</dfn>: A boolean value returned by
            <code><a href=
            "#querycommandstate()">queryCommandState()</a></code>, depending on
            the current state of the document. The <a href="#state">state</a>
            of a <a href="#command">command</a> is true if it is already in
            effect, in some sense specific to the <a href=
            "#command">command</a>. Most <a href="#command" title=
            "command">commands</a> that have a <a href="#state">state</a>
            defined will take opposite <a href="#action" title=
            "action">actions</a> depending on whether the <a href=
            "#state">state</a> is true or false, such as making the selection

          on querying indeterm/state/value, and returns false from

          execCommand and returns false for enabled/state/value. Originally I
          went with IE, although of course with a standard exception type. But

          <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=742240">Mozilla

          value instead of false). The issue is that there are a whole bunch of
          IE commands that no one else supports or wants to support, and
          throwing on execCommand() would make lots of pages break. WebKit was
          unwilling to take the compat risk, so we took the safer option.

          <p>
            IE10PP2 seems to return true if the active range's start node is
            editable, false otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firefox 6.0a2 seems to always return true if there's anything
            editable on the page, and throw otherwise. (This is <a href=
            "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=676401">bug
            676401</a>.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Chrome 14 dev seems to behave the same as IE10PP2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Opera 11.11 seems to always return true if there's anything
            editable on the page, and false otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firefox and Opera behave more or less uselessly. IE doesn't make
            much sense, in that whether a command is enabled seems meaningless:
            it will execute it on all nodes in the selection, editable or not.
            Chrome's definition makes sense in that it will only run the
            command if it's enabled, but it doesn't make much sense to only
            have the command run if the start is editable.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not clear to me what the point of this method is. There's no
            way we're going to always return true if the command will do
            something and false if it won't. I originally just stuck with a
            really conservative definition that happens to be convenient: if
            there's nothing selected, obviously nothing will work, and we want
            to bail out early in that case anyway because all the algorithms
            will talk about the active range. If there are use-cases for it to
            be more precise, I could make it so.

              IE9 consistently returns false for all three. However, any
              command that has a state defined also has a value defined, which
              is equal to the state: it returns boolean true or false.

              Firefox 6.0a2 consistently throws NS_ERROR_FAILURE for
              indeterm/state if not supported, and returns an empty string for
              value. Exceptions include unlink (seems to always return
              indeterm/state false), and styleWithCss/useCss (throw
              NS_ERROR_FAILURE even for value).
            </p>
            <p>
              Chrome 14 dev returns false for all three, and even does this for
              unrecognized commands. It also always defines value if state is
              defined: it returns the state cast to a string, either "true" or
              "false".
            </p>
            <p>
              Opera 11.11 returns false for state and "" for value (it doesn't
              support indeterm). Like Chrome, this is even for unrecognized
              commands.

            <p>
              Gecko's behavior is the most useful. If the author tries querying
              some aspect of a command that makes no sense, they shouldn't
              receive a value that looks like it might make sense but is
              actually just a constant. Originally, I went even further than
              Gecko: I required exceptions even for value, since doing
              otherwise makes no sense. But throwing more exceptions is less
              compatible on the whole than throwing more exceptions, so based
              on <a href=
              "http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-September/033235.html">

              is more or less IE/WebKit behavior but made slightly more sane.

          Firefox 6.0a2 always throws an exception when this is called. Opera
          11.11 seems to return false if there's nothing editable on the page,
          which is unhelpful. The spec follows IE9 and Chrome 14 dev. The
          reason this is useful, compared to just running one of the other
          methods and seeing if you get a NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR, is that other
          methods might throw different exceptions for other reasons. It's
          easier to check a boolean than to check exception types, especially
          since as of June 2011 UAs aren't remotely consistent on what they do
          with unsupported commands.

          Actually, correction: Firefox &lt; 15ish throws an exception if

        <ul>
          <li>
            <code title="">queryCommandIndeterm()</code> will return false (or

            of what it did before <code title="">execCommand()</code> was
            called (or throw an exception).
          </li>
          <li>
            <code title="">queryCommandValue()</code> will return something
            equivalent to the value passed to <code title=

          The first two points do not always hold for <code title=

          it can be impossible to unset text-decoration in CSS. Also, by
          design, the state of <code title="">insertOrderedList</code> and
          <code title="">insertUnorderedList</code> might be true both before
          and after calling, because they only remove one level of indentation.
          <code title="">unlink</code> should set the value to null. And
          finally, the state of the various <code title="">justify</code>
          commands should always be true after calling, and the value should
          always be the appropriate string ("center", "justify", "left", or
          "right"). Any other deviations from these invariants are bugs in the
          specification.

        without moving the cursor, they expect it to have the given style (bold

        overrides, and <a href="#the-inserttext-command"><code title=

        When this specification refers to a method or attribute that is defined
        in a specification, the user agent must treat the method or attribute
        as defined by that specification. In particular, if a script has
        overridden a standard property with a custom one, the user agent must
        only use the overridden property when a script refers to it, and must
        continue to use the specification-defined behavior when this
        specification refers to it.

          as the node is moved, which would corrupt the selection. For
          instance, if the user selects the text "foo" and then bolds it, first
          we produce <code title="">&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;foo</code>, then
          <code title="">&lt;b&gt;foo&lt;/b&gt;</code>. When we move the "foo"
          text node into its new parent, we have to do so "preserving ranges",
          so that the text "foo" is still selected.

          To <dfn id="wrap">wrap</dfn> a list <var title="">node list</var> of
          consecutive [=tree/sibling=] <a class="external" data-anolis-spec=
          "dom" href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node" title=
          "concept-node">nodes</a>, run the following algorithm. In addition to
          <var title="">node list</var>, the algorithm accepts two inputs: an
          algorithm <var title="">sibling criteria</var> that accepts a
          <a class="external" data-anolis-spec="dom" href=
          "http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node" title=
          "concept-node">node</a> as input and outputs a boolean, and an
          algorithm <var title="">new parent instructions</var> that accepts
          nothing as input and outputs a <a class="external" data-anolis-spec=
          "dom" href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node" title=
          "concept-node">node</a> or null. If not provided, <var title=
          "">sibling criteria</var> returns false and <var title="">new parent
          instructions</var> returns null.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          This algorithm basically does two things. First, it looks at the
          previous and next siblings of the nodes in <var title="">node
          list</var>. If running <var title="">sibling criteria</var> on one or
          both of the siblings returns true, the nodes in <var title="">node
          list</var> are moved into the sibling(s). Otherwise, <var title=
          "">new parent instructions</var> is run, and the result is used to
          wrap <var title="">node list</var>. For instance, to wrap <var title=
          "">node list</var> in a <code title="">&lt;b&gt;</code>, one might
          invoke this algorithm with <var title="">sibling criteria</var>
          returning true only for <code title="">&lt;b&gt;</code> elements and
          <var title="">new parent instructions</var> creating and returning a
          new <code title="">&lt;b&gt;</code> element.

              non-extraneous one.

                    Basically, we want any boundary points around the wrapped
                    nodes to go inside the wrapper. Without this step, wrapping
                    "{}&lt;br&gt;" in a blockquote would go like
                  </p>
                  <pre>
{}&lt;br&gt;
-&gt; {}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-&gt; {}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;.
</pre>
                  <p>
                    The second line is due to range mutation rules: a boundary
                    point with an offset equal to the index of a newly-inserted
                    node stays put, so it remains before it. With this step, it
                    goes like
                  </p>
                  <pre>
{}&lt;br&gt;
-&gt; {}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;{}&lt;br&gt;
-&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;{}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;.
</pre>
                  <p>
                    The difference in the final step is because we move the
                    &lt;br&gt; "preserving ranges". This means that adjacent
                    boundary points get swept along with it. Previously, the
                    &lt;blockquote&gt; intervened, so a boundary point after it
                    would get taken along but one before it would not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another solution that one might be tempted to consider
                    would be to just put the wrapper after the wrapped
                    elements. Then the boundary points would stay put, before
                    the wrapper, so they'd still be adjacent to the nodes to be
                    wrapped, like:
                  </p>
                  <pre>
{&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;}
-&gt; {&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
-&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;{&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;.
</pre>
                  <p>
                    The problem is that this completely breaks if you're
                    wrapping multiple things and not all are selected. It would
                    go like this:
                  </p>
                  <pre>
&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;{&lt;p&gt;bar&lt;/p&gt;}
-&gt; &lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;{&lt;p&gt;bar&lt;/p&gt;}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
-&gt; &lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;{&lt;p&gt;bar&lt;/p&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
-&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;{&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;bar&lt;/p&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;.
</pre>
                  <p>
                    The last step is again because of the range mutation rules:
                    the boundary point stays put when a new node is inserted.
                    They're fundamentally asymmetric.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An alternative solution would be to define the concept of
                    moving a list of adjacent sibling nodes while preserving

          Conceptually, a simple modifiable element is a modifiable element

          inline formatting commands will try not to modify anything other than
          modifiable elements. For instance, <code title="">&lt;dfn&gt;</code>
          normally creates italics, but it's not modifiable, so running
          <a href="#the-italic-command">the <code title="">italic</code>
          command</a> will not remove it: it will nest <code title="">&lt;span
          style="font-style: normal"&gt;</code> inside.

        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Loose equivalence needs to be used when comparing effective command
          values to other values, while regular equivalence is used in other
          cases. The effective command value for fontSize is converted to
          pixels, so comparing it to a specified value literally would produce
          false negatives. But a <em>specified</em> value in pixels is actually
          different from a <em>specified</em> value like "small" or "x-large",
          because there is no precise mapping from such keywords to pixels.

          For bold and similar commands, IE 9 RC seems to consider the state
          true or false depending on the first element. All other browsers
          follow the same general idea as the spec, considering a range bold
          only if all text in it is bold, and this seems to match at least
          OpenOffice.org's bold feature. Opera 11.11 seemingly doesn't take CSS
          into account, and only looks at whether something descends from a
          &lt;b&gt;. I couldn't properly test IE9 because it threw exceptions
          (Error: Unspecified error.) on most of the tests I ran. But what I
          have here seems to match Firefox 6.0a2 in every case, and Chrome 14
          dev in all cases with a few exceptions.

            Testing with hiliteColor: Opera 11.11 seems to always return the
            effective command value of the active range's start node. Chrome 14
            dev returns boolean false consistently, bizarrely enough. Firefox
            6.0a2 seems to follow the same idea as the spec, but it likes to
            return "transparent", including sometimes when the answer really
            clearly should not be "transparent". IE9 throws exceptions most of
            the time for backColor, so I can't say for sure, but in the few
            cases where it doesn't throw it returns a random-looking number, so
            I'll assume it's crazy like for foreColor.

            I decided on something that would guarantee the following
            invariant: whenever you execute a command with a value provided
            (assuming value is relevant), queryCommandValue() will always
            return something equivalent to what you set.

          commands where we can't rely on CSS for some reason: createLink and
          unlink aren't CSS-related at all, backColor and hiliteColor need

                    If you do queryCommandValue() for backColor/hiliteColor
                    when no backgrounds are set anywhere, so it goes up to the
                    root element, no two engines agree. IE10PP2 just returns a
                    random-looking number (16777215). Firefox 8.0a2 returns
                    "transparent", Chrome 15 dev returns "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)",
                    and Opera 11.50 returns "rgb(255, 255, 255)".

                  <p>
                    Opera's behavior is incorrect. The current page might be an
                    iframe, in which case the background really will be
                    transparent and the (inaccessible) background color of the
                    parent page will show through. Also, the user might have
                    changed their preferences, but I'm not too worried about
                    that.

                  <p>
                    So instead we just return the value as-is. This means that
                    it will be fully transparent, which is perhaps somewhat
                    useless information, but it's the best we can do. More
                    generally, any non-opaque value is not going to tell you
                    what you actually want, namely "what color is the user
                    actually seeing?" We have no realistic way to work around
                    this in the general case.

          <p>
            This algorithm goes up to just below the nearest ancestor with the
            right style, then re-applies the bad styles repeatedly going down,
            omitting the things we want to have the new style. This is
            basically what WebKit does, although WebKit sometimes starts higher
            up and therefore makes more intrusive changes, often creating more
            markup. IE follows the same general approach too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gecko instead seems to start breaking up elements from the bottom,
            so that the range consists of a few consecutive siblings, and it
            can then break up the problematic element into a maximum of two
            pieces. The spec's approach seems to create fewer elements and
            simpler markup (or at least markup that's no more complex) in most
            cases I throw at it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gecko's approach does have the major advantage that it gets
            underlines right in many cases for free. E.g.,
          </p>
          <pre>
&lt;u&gt;foo&lt;font color=red&gt;[bar]baz&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
-&gt; &lt;u&gt;foo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;bar&lt;u&gt;baz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt; (spec)
-&gt; &lt;u&gt;foo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;bar&lt;/font&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;baz&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt; (Gecko)
</pre>
          <p>
            The spec's markup here is much shorter and contains fewer elements,
            but is wrong: the underline under "baz" has changed color from
            black to red. It might be worth trying to copy Gecko's results in
            such cases, but that won't solve all underline problems, so perhaps
            it's not worth it.

            Opera also seems to break up the markup surrounding the range, but
            even more aggressively: even if it doesn't need to pull down
            styles. In some cases this does actually result in shorter markup,
            specifically if the existing tags are short (like i or b) and we're
            adding tags that are long (like span with a style attribute).

                Nevertheless, Chrome 14 dev does seem to do this. Running bold
                on &lt;span style=font-weight:300&gt;f[o]o&lt;/span&gt; breaks
                up the span and adds a &lt;b&gt; as a sibling. In IE9, Firefox
                6.0a2, and Opera 11.50, it instead nests the &lt;b&gt; inside
                the &lt;span&gt;. It's a tradeoff: WebKit's behavior is better
                for things like
              </p>
              <pre>
&lt;font color=red&gt;fo[o&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=blue&gt;b]ar&lt;/font&gt;
-&gt; &lt;font color=red&gt;fo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=green&gt;[ob]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=blue&gt;ar&lt;/font&gt;
</pre>
              <p>
                (where the spec adds two extra font tags instead of one), but
                the spec is simpler for things like
              </p>
              <pre>
&lt;font color=red&gt;f[o]o&lt;/font&gt;
-&gt; &lt;font color=red&gt;f&lt;font color=green&gt;[o]&lt;/font&gt;o&lt;/font&gt;
</pre>
              <p>
                (where WebKit splits the existing tag up in addition to
                creating a new tag). I'm not particularly sure which approach
                is better overall, so I'll go with the majority of browsers. If
                these algorithms move to use runs of consecutive siblings
                instead of doing everything node-by-node, it might make sense
                to break up the parent as long as it won't create an extra node
                (i.e., we're styling something that includes the first or last
                child).

                  sure what the point is, and no one else does, so I don't.
                  WebKit seems to ignore the node if its only child consists
                  solely of whitespace, but I don't see any grounds for that
                  and no one else does, so I don't.

                If candidate had no children, any boundary point inside it will
                get moved to its parent here, which is okay. We don't want to
                preserve ranges, because that would move boundary points that
                originally were in candidate but were moved to its parent by
                the last step to move to node's parent.

              <p>
                We move to after node so that boundary points before and after

          <p>
            The effect of this algorithm is to ensure that all nodes <a href=
            "#effectively-contained">effectively contained</a> in the selection
            have the value requested, producing the simplest markup possible to
            achieve that effect. It's inspired by the approach WebKit takes.
            The only places where the algorithm should fail are when there's an
            !important CSS rule that conflicts with the requested style (which
            we don't try to override because we assume it's !important for a
            reason), or when it's literally impossible to succeed (such as when
            a text-decoration or link URL is propagated from a non-editable
            ancestor). Any other failures are bugs.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, if a node has a <a href="#specified-command-value">specified
            command value</a> for the command, we unset it (<a href=
            "#clear-the-value" title="clear the value">clear its value</a>).
            This step also removes <a href="#simple-modifiable-element" title=
            "simple modifiable element">simple modifiable elements</a>
            entirely, and replaces elements like [^b^] or [^font^] with
            [^span^]s if they aren't simple modifiable elements. This will be
            sufficient if the desired value is inherited from an ancestor, or
            if it's the default (like font-style: normal) and no conflicting
            value is inherited from an ancestor. Even if clearing values
            doesn't actually fix the style of the node we're dealing with, we
            do it anyway to simplify the generated markup.
          </p>
          <p>
            If clearing values didn't work, and it looks like an ancestor has a
            <a href="#specified-command-value">specified command value</a> that
            we're inheriting, we push the value down from that ancestor. Thus
            if we're unbolding the letter "r" in
          </p>
          <pre>
<b>foo <i>bar</i> baz</b>,
</pre>
          <p>
            we get
          </p>
          <pre>
<b>foo </b><i><b>ba</b>r</i><b> baz</b>.
</pre>
          <p>
            If we didn't push down values, the final step (forcing values)
            would instead give us
          </p>
          <pre>
<b>foo <i>ba<span style="font-weight: normal">r</span></i> baz</b>,
</pre>
          <p>
            which is much longer and uglier. We take care not to disturb the
            style or semantics of anything but the node we're dealing with.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll only push down values if some ancestor actually has the value
            we want, so we can inherit it. Otherwise, it will just create
            useless markup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, if neither of the above strategies worked, we have to add
            new markup to get the desired value (<a href="#force-the-value"
            title="force the value">forcing the value</a>). First we try just
            sticking it into its previous or next sibling, if that's a <a href=
            "#simple-modifiable-element">simple modifiable element</a> (so it
            won't add any styles or semantics we don't want). Otherwise, we
            create a new simple modifiable element and wrap it in that. It's
            common that a previous sibling is the simple modifiable element we
            want, because often we'll set the value of several consecutive
            siblings in succession. In that case, the element created for the
            first can be reused for the later ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            This last step works a bit differently if the node isn't an
            <a href="#allowed-child">allowed child</a> of "span". In that case,
            wrapping it in a simple modifiable element would make the document
            less conforming than it already was, or would cause other problems.
            Instead, we recursively force the value of its children. The
            recursion will terminate when we hit a node that's an allowed child
            of "span", or when there are no further descendants. (In the latter
            case, there are no descendants that are text nodes or such, so we
            don't really need to style anything.)
          </p>
          <p>
            After all this, the node is guaranteed to have the value we want,
            barring bugs in the algorithm or the two exceptions noted earlier
            (!important style rules, and impossible cases). We then re-run the
            algorithm on each child recursively. Typically this means just
            clearing the value of each descendant, because it should then
            inherit the value we just set on its ancestor. In the unusual case
            that a descendant's value is wrong even after we clear its value,
            such as because of a non-inline style rule (like trying to unbold a
            heading), we'll repeat the above steps to ensure that the value
            really gets set as desired.

                "http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-April/031147.html">
                discussion</a>. Ignoring non-editable things is convenient for
                the common use-case of an editor, where you don't want the user
                to bold random parts of the UI when they hit the bold button.
                For cases where it's not desired, you can always turn
                designMode on briefly before using execCommand(), so the non-IE
                behavior is a lot easier to work around than the IE behavior.
              </p>
              <p>
                I don't see the value in ever just ignoring execCommand(). If
                the start and end are not editable, I'm going to say you should
                still style any editable nodes in between. I'm also going to
                ignore non-editable nodes for the purposes of determining
                state, so (for instance) if all the editable nodes are bolded,
                it will unbold instead of bolding.

          For historical reasons, backColor and hiliteColor behave identically.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>
            We have three behaviors to choose from for this one:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Chrome 11 dev and IE 9 RC treat it the same as hiliteColor
            (although IE 9 RC doesn't support hiliteColor itself).
            </li>
            <li>Firefox 4 in non-CSS mode sets the bgcolor of the nearest td or
            body, or something like that. In testing, it seems to jump out of
            contenteditable elements to style non-editable ancestors, which is
            alarming.
            </li>
            <li>Firefox 4 in CSS mode and Opera 11 set the background of the
            nearest block container, although it doesn't seem to be very
            dependable (probably I just don't get what exactly it's doing).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            (1) is obviously redundant, but has plurality support, so we could
            spec it that way if the other ways were useless.
          </p>
          <p>
            (3) is incoherent from a user perspective. For instance, if you try
            it on paragraphs the background will have big gaps where the
            margins are. If you try it on an inline element that's a child of
            the editing host, it will do nothing or apply the background to
            everything or such, even though such an inline element is visually
            indistinguishable from one sitting inside a div. This would only
            make sense if we take considerable effort to ensure that block
            elements all have no margins, or if we wrap things in a div if they
            have margins, or something like that.
          </p>
          <p>
            That leaves (2). That might be useful if it actually set the
            document's background color, but it seems like it sets table cell
            backgrounds sometimes instead, which is really confusing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The path of least resistance is to standardize this as meaning the
            same thing as hiliteColor, and make up new commands if we want to
            do things like set the document background color. See hiliteColor
            for comments.

          If the selection is collapsed (but not if it contains nothing but is
          not collapsed), IE9 wraps the whole line in a &lt;strong&gt;. This
          seems bizarre and no one else does it, so I don't do it. It's a
          similar story for similar commands (fontName, italic, etc.). Except
          not for strikethrough, where it just does nothing if the selection is
          empty. Why strikethrough? I don't know.

          <a href="#action">Action</a>: If <code title=

        <div class="note">
          <p>
            The cutoff of 600 matches Chrome 14 dev. The cutoff used by IE9 and
            Firefox 6.0a2 seems to be 500, and the distinction isn't relevant
            for Opera 11.11 (it doesn't use CSS here at all AFAICT). On my test
            systems with default fonts, Chrome 14 dev displays 700 and up as
            bold, while the other three display 600 and up as bold.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in Chrome on my system, the bold command will behave a bit
            oddly the first time you hit it if there's anything in the range
            with font-weight: 600, but it will look right in other browsers. On
            the other hand, if I followed IE/Firefox, it would look wrong on
            all my browsers for font-weight: 500.
          </p>
          <p>
            700 actually makes more sense: then you'd view 100-300 as light,
            400-600 as medium, 700-900 as bold. But that's not how it seems to
            work in browsers, so I'll go with 600 as the cutoff.

            If the selection doesn't contain anything (meaning, e.g.,

            previously defined indeterminate and value anyway because they make

              Firefox 4b11 and Chrome 11 dev both silently do nothing in this

              Gecko and WebKit probably have it right here: users who enter no
              URL are very unlikely to want to link to a relative URL resolving
              to the current document. If they really want to, they can always
              specify "#" for the value, or the author can rewrite it, so it's

                here:
              </p>
              <pre>

                Chrome 10 dev produces:

</pre>
              <p>
                Firefox 4b11 produces (roughly):

&lt;a href=http://example.com&gt;&lt;b&gt;A&lt;a href=http://example.org&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

              <p>
                (This doesn't round-trip through text/html serialization.) IE 9
                RC and Opera 11 produce simply:
              </p>

                The last behavior probably best matches user expectations. If
                you happen to miss out a character when selecting the link you
                want to change, do you really intend to only change the link of
                part of it?

            Setting an empty font-family has the effect of inheriting the font
            from the parent (although I don't see where the February 24, 2011
            CSS 3 Fonts draft says that). Thus it makes sense that if we
            special-case this, it should be to unset the font somehow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Special-casing the empty string to do nothing doesn't make sense to
            me. With createLink we'd expect the user to enter the URL
            themselves, so it makes sense to special-case clicking OK without
            entering anything. But here it's very likely that the font list
            will be fixed by the author (how many users will understand CSS
            font-family syntax?), so I don't think such usability concerns
            apply.

              Confusing. Sometimes it returns generic family names, like
              "sans-serif". Sometimes it gives specific font names, like "tt"
              when the font is specified as "monospace". Sometimes it gives the
              literal font-family string. Not sure what it's doing here.

            I'm just going to punt on this and say it should be the resolved
            value of font-family. I'll leave CSSOM to decide what that means if
            there are no applicable style rules.

            What all of these have in common is that they force the author to
            deal with legacy font values and don't let them use CSS. This is
            undesirable, but to avoid it we'd really have to create a new
            command. If nothing else, the value returned by <code title=
            "">queryCommandValue()</code> has to be numeric, so authors can't
            really use the command sanely no matter what we do. See <a href=

            Note that 1 is the same size as x-small in browsers, not xx-small,

              The entry for 7 here is an issue: there's no CSS value that
              corresponds to it. Even if we got one added to the drafts, it
              wouldn't be backward-compatible to use it. WebKit is the only
              engine that supports CSS output for fontSize, and it uses
              -webkit-xxx-large in this case, which is unworkable. Instead, we
              just always output a font tag for size 7. If authors want
              conforming markup, they'll need to give CSS sizes above size 7,
              not legacy sizes.

          This follows Firefox 6.0a2. Chrome 14 dev always returns false. Note
          that indeterminacy here keys off the effective command value, while
          the value is based only on an approximation (a number from one to
          seven). Thus it's possible for every subrange of the selection to
          have the same value, but for the selection to still be indeterminate.
          Setting the fontSize to the value will make it determinate without
          changing anything's value.

            Chrome's behavior seems the most useful. As usual, IE returns a

            The interpretations given for Firefox are only in styleWithCSS
            mode. In non-styleWithCSS mode, it just outputs the string
            literally as the &lt;font color&gt; attribute value, which can lead
            to different results. The given output for Chrome is for
            &lt;font&gt;; the output in styleWithCSS mode is the same, but
            rgb() is used instead of hex notation, and "transparent" and
            "currentcolor" are passed through under those names. IE and Opera
            only support &lt;font&gt; to begin with.

            Conclusions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Everyone accepts simple color keywords and #xxxxxx notation.
            </li>
            <li>Opera mangles #xxx, but everyone else handles it fine.
            </li>
            <li>The leading # is optional in all browsers but Gecko.
            </li>
            <li>rgb() is accepted by everyone but Opera.
            </li>
            <li>rgba() and hsl() are accepted by Gecko and WebKit, but rejected
            by IE and Opera.
            </li>
            <li>IE and Opera mangle unrecognized stuff, Gecko and WebKit
            ignore.
            </li>
            <li>Browsers will happily output stuff like "transparent" and
            "rgba()" into &lt;font color&gt; even though it won't be uniformly
            accepted there.
            </li>
            <li>Opera and WebKit normalize the output color very aggressively,
            Gecko leaves keywords intact but otherwise normalizes for CSS
            output (but doesn't normalize at all for &lt;font&gt;), and IE
            normalizes inconsistently.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            What I'm going to say is that it either has to be a valid CSS
            color, or prefixing it with # must result in a valid CSS color. For
            <code title="">&lt;font&gt;</code>, I'll say that the output color
            should be normalized to #xxxxxx form. If the color is not a simple
            color (fully opaque with all channels between 0 and 255), I'll
            force <code title="">style=""</code> even if styleWithCSS mode is
            off. Some of this disagrees with all browsers, but it's unlikely to
            hurt and it makes sense.

            Opera 11 seems to return true for the state if there's some color
            style applied, false otherwise, which seems fairly useless; authors
            want to use value here, not state. So I'll match other browsers and
            not define any state.

            For value, the spec essentially matches Firefox 6.0a2 and Chrome 14
            dev, as far as how to decide what color the node has. IE9 seems to
            always return the number 0 for some bizarre reason. There are some
            cases where Firefox returns the empty string for some reason, and
            it seems to select the active node a little differently. Opera uses
            #xxxxxx format for getComputedStyle() but rgb() here, and also
            drops the transparent part of the color if there is any.

        <div class="note">
          <p>
            IE 9 RC doesn't support this. It uses backColor instead, but Gecko
            and Opera treat that differently, while all non-IE browsers treat
            hiliteColor the same, so I'm standardizing hiliteColor as the way
            to highlight text.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is slightly tricky, because background-color does different
            things on block and inline elements. Given the name
            ("hiliteColor"), we really only want to apply it to inline
            elements. This is how everyone but Gecko behaves, but Gecko
            sometimes applies it to blocks too. WebKit doesn't set it on
            non-inline elements, but does clear it and push it down from them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The spec doesn't do any of these: background-color on non-inline
            elements is not touched by hiliteColor, neither created nor
            removed. If users want to remove the style, they need to use
            removeFormat. Adding it usually makes no sense; see the comment for
            backColor.

          <p>
            All elements whose default rendering is display: block are left
            untouched by all browsers (although IE seems to throw an exception
            on &lt;marquee&gt; for some reason).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not clear to me why we should leave &lt;a&gt; alone, but
            everyone but Opera does. In OpenOffice.org 3.2.1, doing "Default
            Formatting (Ctrl+M)" doesn't remove links. In Microsoft Word 2007,
            doing "Clear Formatting" also doesn't remove links. Verdict: don't
            remove links. Apparently they don't logically qualify as
            "formatting".
          </p>
          <p>
            Conclusion: IE/WebKit is a solid majority by market share and
            they're closely interoperable, since WebKit copied IE here. Also,
            it makes more sense to assume that unrecognized elements don't
            represent any kind of inline formatting, i.e., have a blacklist of
            elements to remove instead of a whitelist to keep. Thus I remove
            more or less the same things as IE/WebKit.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remove blink because IE does it and it makes sense, although
            Chrome doesn't; I remove abbr although only Firefox does, for
            consistency with acronym; and I remove bdi and mark because they're
            evidently left alone only because they're unrecognized. Finally, I
            remove span because otherwise, something like <code title=
            "">&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps"&gt;</code> will be
            left intact, which isn't expected and matches no browser except IE.
            (Chrome doesn't remove spans in general, but it does remove spans
            with style attributes, or something like that.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Browsers will split up all these inline elements if the selection
            is contained within them. Opera does strip unrecognized elements
            with display: block if they're within the selection, but doesn't
            split them up if they contain the selection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chrome 14 dev removes style attributes from every element in the
            range, but IE10PP2, Firefox 7.0a2, and Opera 11.50 do not, so I go
            with them. As noted above, this means I need to remove spans. I
            could conceivably change to remove only spans with style
            attributes, but it doesn't seem worth it: I'll just match Gecko.

          for subscript but not superscript, and indeterminate is false. We
          follow neither of these behaviors: we return false for both states,
          and say indeterminate is true. The reason is because we want to
          return true for a state if we'll do nothing, false if we'll do
          something; and if we have nesting like this, we'll always do
          something, namely get rid of all those ancestors and replace them
          with a single tag. This matches what happens in other indeterminate
          situations, so it's fair to consider it indeterminate.

          <p>
            TODO: There are a lot of problems with underline color and
            thickness, because text-decoration in CSS is horrible. These aren't
            prohibitive for normal use and existing browsers don't handle them
            either, so fixing these problems or working around them can be put
            off for now.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pushing down underlines can change their color, since the color
            of an underline follows the color of the element where it's
            declared instead of the text it's drawn under. This could be fixed
            by adding a special case for this condition and inserting extra
            color rules, such as by setting a color on the underlining element
            and then having another element inside it that resets the color.
            Horrible, but that's text-decoration for you. Alternatively, the
            new text-decoration-color property in the CSS 3 Text draft could
            come in handy here, in which case we'd degrade pretty gracefully in
            legacy UAs.
            </li>
            <li>Underline thickness depends on font-size in all rendering
            engines but WebKit, so pushing them down creates thickness problems
            as well as color problems. Working around this is a similar story
            to the previous, except we have no text-decoration-width property
            yet (see <a href=
            "https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Mar/0593.html">
              www-style post</a>).
            </li>
            <li>The preceding two points can't be avoided, because the only way
            to remove underlines in CSS is to push down styles (unlike most
            other things where you could override it). Recent (February 2011)
            CSS 3 Text drafts have added support for a "text-decoration-line:
            cancel-underline" property, but we can only use that if there's no
            other possibility, since it won't work in legacy browsers.
            (Although we should use it once there's no other possibility.)
            </li>
            <li>More generally, from a user's perspective, color and thickness
            of underlines is going to be more or less random if they're
            applying them to text with varying size or color. If they underline
            a bunch of text all at once, it will all get the same
            color/thickness, probably. But if they underline letter-by-letter,
            it probably will vary. But sometimes when they underline a bunch of
            text at once it will also vary, if the algorithm decides to create
            multiple elements for whatever reason (like an intervening
            unwrappable node). This is unlikely to match user expectations.
            There's not much we can do about this without entirely revamping
            text-decoration, so we'll have to live with it.
            </li>
            <li>Currently we don't treat non-underline text-decorations
            properly, because we have no way to set (or cancel) underlines
            independently of other text-decorations from within CSS. I've sent

          class="webkit-indent-blockquote". We need to allow stuff that sets
          dir because IE9 does. The criteria could probably be tightened up a
          bit to reduce false positives, but it'll do for now.

            This algorithm implies that we don't support a sublist in the
            middle of an item, only at the end. For instance,
          </p>
          <pre>
&lt;li&gt;foo&lt;ol&gt;...&lt;/ol&gt;bar&lt;/li&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
            gets transformed to
          </p>
          <pre>
&lt;li&gt;foo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;...&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;bar&lt;/li&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
            which in particular creates an extra list marker for "bar". This is
            okay; we don't need to expose all of HTML's markup abilities
            through execCommand(). Similarly, the superscript and subscript
            commands don't allow nesting. I didn't see any way to get a sublist
            in the middle of an item in Word 2007 or in OpenOffice.org 3.2.1
            Ubuntu package, nor in any browser using just execCommand(), so it
            should be no big problem if we require that such nesting not occur.
            (Existing browsers behave weirdly and inconsistently when
            confronted with this kind of nesting.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason we need this is that otherwise it gets very confusing to
            figure out what happens in cases like trying to outdent
          </p>
          <pre>
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;[foo&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;bar]&lt;/ol&gt;baz&lt;/ol&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
            If we first normalize, then the natural answer is something like
          </p>
          <pre>
&lt;p&gt;[foo&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;bar]&lt;li&gt;baz&lt;/ol&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
            but if we don't, we'd have to special-case in the toggle lists and
            outdent algorithms. This might be worthwhile, but it's not at all
            clear, and what I have works okay, so I'll stick with it for now.

                because of the magical li handling in block-extend. We want

            When querying the value of justify*, IE9 seems to return boolean
            false across the board when it doesn't throw exceptions, which it
            usually does in my tests. Chrome 14 dev returns the string "true"
            or "false" depending on state, as in other cases, which is useless.
            Opera 11.11 returns "" across the board. Firefox 6.0a2 behaves like
            with other command values: it returns
            "center"/"justify"/"left"/"right" depending on the active range's
            start node. Since this is the only behavior that's possibly useful,
            it's what I specced. Firefox ties the value closely to the state,
            returning true for the state if and only if the value matches the
            desired value, but this seems less useful than what I've specced
            for the state.

            This API is based on the four-state text-align of CSS 2.1. We do
            some crude mapping to make it not break too badly with CSS3 values,
            but it's not going to work well given the design of the API.

          This is basically like the resolved value of text-align, but with two
          key differences. First, it only ever evaluates to
          center/justify/left/right, since that's the model that the justify
          commands work with. Second, it ignores inline elements, because
          text-align has no effect on them and their alignment is actually
          governed by their nearest block ancestor (if any).

              This means there's no applicable style rule, so probably it will

              it's a pretty marginal corner case anyway. (It will only happen

          Sometimes one location corresponds to multiple distinct boundary

          beginning of the text node or the beginning of the element node, but
          these don't logically differ much and will appear the same to the
          user, so we often want to treat them the same. The algorithms here
          allow navigating through such equivalent boundary points, for when we
          want to make the selection as inclusive or exclusive as possible. For
          deletion, we want to delete as few nodes as possible, so we move the
          start node forward and the end node backward. In other cases we might
          do the reverse, expanding the selection. In still other cases we
          might want to move forward or backward to try getting to a text node.

            Generally, block commands work on any block that contains part of
            the selection, even if the selection doesn't include the whole
            block. This algorithm takes an input range, copies it, stretches
            out the copy to contain entire blocks, and returns the result. Then
            the caller will normally use it instead of the range it started
            with. For instance, if the cursor is collapsed in a text node
            inside a paragraph, this will generally return a range that
            includes the whole paragraph.

            Two bits of magic worth noting. First, <code title=
            "">&lt;br&gt;</code> counts as a block delimiter here, since it
            looks the same as a block boundary (assuming no margin etc.) and
            this is a visual API. We include the <code title=
            "">&lt;br&gt;</code> as part of the line that precedes it. Second,
            if the selection is inside an <code title="">&lt;li&gt;</code>,
            this will extend it to include the whole <code title=
            "">&lt;li&gt;</code>. This latter point is weird, and I should
            re-examine it sometime, but it seems to work.

                When restoring, some commands can interfere with others.
                Specifically, we want to restore createLink before foreColor
                and underline, and subscript and superscript before fontSize.
                TODO: This approach only works for default styles (although I'm

                Firefox 7.0a2 and Opera 11.50 don't honor createLink with
                collapsed selections. If you insert text, it's not linked. The
                spec follows Chrome 14 dev. IE9 also ignores createLink with
                collapsed selections, but its behavior in other cases for
                collapsed selections is totally different from all other
                browsers, so it's not a fair comparison.

          To <dfn id="delete-the-selection">delete the selection</dfn>, given a
          <var title="">block merging</var> flag that defaults to true, a

          string <var title="">direction</var> that defaults to "forward":

        <div class="note">
          <p>
            The idea behind this algorithm is self-explanatory, but the details
            wind up being remarkably complicated.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, any editable nodes inside the selection will be deleted, and
            the selection will be collapsed. By way of contrast, <a href=
            "#effectively-contained">effectively contained</a> tries to expand
            the range to include as much as possible, so <code title=
            "">&lt;p&gt;[foo]&lt;/p&gt;</code> contains the <code title=
            "">&lt;p&gt;</code>. What we do here is contract the range to
            include as little as possible, so <code title=
            "">{&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;}</code> contains only <code title=
            "">foo</code> and doesn't delete the paragraph.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, if the selection originally started and ended in
            different blocks, and the <var title="">block merging</var> flag is
            true, the end block will get merged into the start block. This is
            needed so if the user selects text on several lines and deletes it,
            the text immediately that was before the selection winds up on the
            same line as the text immediately after it. For example,
            <code title=
            "">&lt;p&gt;fo[o&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;b]ar&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            becomes <code title="">&lt;p&gt;fo[]ar&lt;/p&gt;</code>. This
            procedure winds up being tricky, and takes up a large chunk of the
            logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tables are a notable special case. If an entire table is contained
            in the range, it will be deleted. If it's anything less, only the
            contents of the cells will be deleted and the table structure will
            be left intact.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <var title="">strip wrappers</var> flag controls what happens
            if the deletion removes all the contents of an inline element. If
            wrappers are being stripped, the empty inline element will be
            removed: this is usually what you want, because the user can't
            position the selection inside it. But callers like <a href=
            "#the-inserttext-command">the <code title="">insertText</code>
            command</a> that intend to immediately insert new contents want to
            leave the wrappers, so the new contents are wrapped by the same
            thing as the old.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if <var title="">strip wrappers</var> is true, the algorithm
            will set a <a href="#state-override">state override</a> and
            <a href="#value-override">value override</a> for any styles it
            winds up removing. This way, if the user deletes a wrapper that
            adds a style (or link for that matter), then types something, the
            new text will get the style from the old text.

              <p>
                We only merge to or from block nodes or editing hosts. (This is
                just in case someone makes a span into an editing host and
                sticks paragraphs inside it or something . . . we could
                probably drop that proviso.) Firefox 7.0a2 ignores the display
                property when merging, so it doesn't merge <code title=
                "">&lt;span style=display:block&gt;</code> but does merge
                <code title="">&lt;p style=display:inline&gt;</code>. This is
                undesirable, because it's visually wrong. IE10PP2 and Chrome 14
                dev behave more like the spec, and Opera 11.50 seems to be
                unable to make up its mind.
              </p>
              <p>
                If span isn't an allowed child, it's probably something
                unpleasant like a table row or a list or such. We don't want to
                merge to or from something like that, because we'd most likely
                wind up with the wrong type of child somewhere. It should be
                pretty hard for this to happen given the normalization we do on
                the selection; I'm not actually sure how it could happen at
                all, actually, unless you start out with a DOM that has
                non-allowed children someplace. So it's basically a sanity
                check.
              </p>
              <p>
                We don't let either start block or end block be a td or th.
                This means we'll never merge to or from a td or th. This
                matches Firefox 5.0a2, and reportedly Word as well. Chrome 13
                dev and Opera 11.11 allow merging from a non-table cell end
                block to a table cell start block, but not vice versa. In IE9
                the delete key just does nothing.

                  places still need to be removed, because they would otherwise
                  remain empty.

          <var title="">node list</var> of consecutive [=tree/sibling=]

          <p>
            This algorithm breaks up the parent of <var title="">node
            list</var>. If they're the only children of their parent, the
            parent is removed entirely. If there are preceding or following
            siblings, the original parent is left intact as the parent of those
            siblings. If there are both preceding and following siblings, the
            original parent is left as the parent of the following siblings and
            a clone is used for the parent of the preceding siblings.
          </p>
          <p>
            We make sure not to disrupt the appearance any more than necessary.
            Obviously margins or such on the parent will be lost, but the
            children will not wind up on the same line as anything they weren't
            already on the same line as. E.g., if we split the parent of "bar"
            in <code title="">foo&lt;p&gt;bar&lt;/p&gt;</code>, we get
            <code title="">foo&lt;br&gt;bar</code>, not <code title=
            "">foobar</code>. (This is amazingly complicated and error-prone.)
            We don't preserve inline styles: callers that want to do that
            should call <a href="#record-the-values">record the values</a> and
            <a href="#restore-the-values">restore the values</a> themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            All this is useful in a lot of situations, like for outdenting. For
            inline formatting commands, we almost always rely on <a href=
            "#push-down-values" title="push down values">pushing down
            values</a> instead, since that often leads to tidier markup.

          Canonical space sequences
        </h3>
        <div class="note">
          <p>
            Whitespace in HTML normally collapses. However, if the user hits
            the space bar twice in an HTML editor, they expect to see two
            spaces, not one. Even if they hit the space bar once at the
            beginning or end of a line, it would collapse without special
            handling. The only good solution here is for the author to set
            white-space: pre-wrap on the editable area, and on everywhere the
            content is reproduced. But if they don't, we have to painfully hack
            around the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a basically intractable problem because of the unfortunate
            confluence of three factors. One, our characters are Unicode, and
            Unicode doesn't know about whitespace collapsing, so it provides no
            special characters to control it. Two, HTML itself provides no
            features that control whitespace collapsing without undesired side
            effects (like inhibiting line breaks or not being allowed inside
            <code title="">&lt;p&gt;</code>). Three, we need to support user
            agents that don't reliably support CSS, since that includes many
            popular mail clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            The upshot is we have no good way to control whitespace collapse,
            so we rely on the least bad way available: <code title=
            "">&amp;nbsp;</code>. This doesn't collapse with adjacent
            whitespace in browsers, which is good. But it also doesn't allow a
            line break opportunity, which is bad. In any run of whitespace that
            we don't want to collapse, any two regular spaces must be separated
            by an <code title="">&amp;nbsp;</code> so they don't collapse
            together, but we need to carefully limit runs of consecutive
            <code title="">&amp;nbsp;</code>s to minimize the damage to
            line-breaking behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result is an elaborate and meticulously-crafted hodgepodge of
            bad compromises that frankly isn't worth the effort to explain
            here. The saving grace is that it all gets disabled if white-space
            is set to pre-wrap as it should be, so authors can opt out of the
            insanity. Interested readers will find detailed rationale for the
            exact sequences required in the comments.

          Indenting and outdenting
        </h3>
        <div class="note">
          <p>
            There are two basically different types of indent/outdent: lists,
            and everything else. For lists we'll wrap the item in a nested list
            to indent, and <a href="#split-the-parent" title=
            "split the parent">split its parent</a> to outdent. For everything
            else we'll wrap in a <code title="">&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> to
            indent, and try breaking it out of an ancestor <a href=
            "#indentation-element">indentation element</a> to outdent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indenting winds up being pretty simple: just add an appropriate
            wrapper. There's not really anything to think about here except
            which wrapper we want (<code title="">&lt;ol&gt;</code> or
            <code title="">&lt;ul&gt;</code> or <code title=
            "">&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>), and establishing that is not rocket
            science.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outdenting is considerably more complicated. The basic idea we
            follow is to first find the nearest editable ancestor that's a list
            or <a href="#indentation-element">indentation element</a>. If we
            succeed, and the node we're trying to outdent is the only
            descendant of the ancestor, of course we can just remove the
            ancestor and that's that. Otherwise, what we do is remove the
            ancestor and then indent all its other descendants, much like
            <a href="#push-down-values" title="push down values">pushing down
            values</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But of course, there are complications. We don't always actually
            want to remove the <em>closest</em> ancestor that's causing
            indentation. For one thing, we prefer ancestors that we can remove
            completely, i.e., <a href="#simple-indentation-element" title=
            "simple indentation element">simple indentation elements</a>. When
            outdenting <code title="">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote
            id="abc"&gt;foo&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code>,
            removing the inner tag would result in <code title=
            "">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div
            id="abc"&gt;foo&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code>, since we
            don't want to lose the id. Thus we prefer to remove the outer tag
            and wind up with <code title="">&lt;blockquote
            id="abc"&gt;foo&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, if the node we're outdenting is itself a list, we prefer to
            remove an ancestor <a href="#indentation-element">indentation
            element</a> rather than the list. Otherwise, if the user selected
            some text, indented it, then added a list, there would be no way to
            remove the indentation without removing the list first. This way,
            the user could remove the list with the appropriate list-toggling
            command or remove the indentation with the outdent command.

            We have to handle entire lists of siblings at once, or else we'd
            wind up doing something like

          <pre>
&lt;ol&gt;
  {&lt;li&gt;foo&lt;/li&gt;

                    This matches IE9, Firefox 4.0, and Chrome 12 dev. If
                    there's a preceding &lt;li&gt;, Opera 11.10 instead adds
                    the new parent to the end of that &lt;li&gt;, so it's not
                    the child of another list, which is invalid. But the other
                    browsers' way of doing things makes things simpler. E.g.,
                    if we want to indent an &lt;li&gt; and it has
                    &lt;ol&gt;/&lt;ul&gt; children, we have to distinguish
                    between the case where we want to indent the whole
                    &lt;li&gt; or only the first part. It also allows things
                    like
                  </p>

                Firefox 4.0 respects the CSS styling flag for indent, but
                Chrome 12 dev does not. I always produce blockquotes, even if
                CSS styling is on, for two reasons. One, IE9 handles inline
                margin attributes badly: when outdenting, it propagates the
                margin to the parent, which doesn't actually remove it. Two, in
                CSS mode I'd want to use &lt;div style="margin: 1em 40px"&gt;
                to match non-CSS mode, but authors are very likely to want to
                remove the top/bottom margin, which they can't do if it's not a
                special tag. Authors who really want divs for indentation could
                always convert the blockquotes to divs themselves. But if
                people really want it, I could respect CSS styling mode here
                too.
              </p>
              <p>
                The top/bottom margins might be undesirable here, but no more
                so than for &lt;ol&gt;/&lt;ul&gt;/&lt;p&gt;/etc. Here as there,
                authors can remove them with CSS if they want.

                blockquote indents on both sides, so we don't have to worry
                about directionality. In theory it would be better if we
                indented only on the start side, but that requires care to get
                right in mixed-direction cases. Even once browsers start to
                support margin-start and so on, we can't use them because a) we
                have to work okay in legacy browsers and b) it doesn't help if
                a descendant block has different direction (so should be
                indented the other way). So let's not worry about it: most
                browsers don't, and the ones that do get it wrong. Just indent
                on both sides.

            Gecko in CSS mode just adds margin properties to random elements
            that are lying around. We don't attempt to remove those, because 1)
            the amount and position of the margin can vary (it increases the
            margin if there's a preexisting one), so it's potentially
            complicated, and 2) no browser removes such margins on outdent,
            including Gecko, except for Gecko in CSS mode. TODO: Consider
            removing it anyway.

              The easy case is when the whole element is indented. In this case
              we remove the whole thing indiscriminately. In the case of

              some children, but then their direction was probably changed
              incorrectly in the first place, so no harm.

                Approximate algorithms when an ancestor is causing the
                indentation appear to be:
              </p>
              <dl>
                <dt>
                  IE9
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  Go to the innermost element causing indentation. If the stuff
                  to be outdented includes all the contents of that element,
                  get rid of it, but if it has any attributes, change it to a
                  &lt;p&gt; with those same attributes. This is an excellent
                  idea in general, but unfortunately it preserves
                  explicitly-specified margins in style attributes, which isn't
                  great. In other cases, it moves the stuff to be outdented
                  outside. Not clear on all the details, seems to be pretty
                  confusing. Also does a bunch of seemingly arbitrary
                  normalization like removing divs and some attributes from
                  some things . . .
                </dd>
                <dt>

                <dd>
                  Go to the innermost element causing indentation. If the stuff
                  to be outdented includes all the contents of that element,
                  get rid of it, even if it has arbitrary attributes.
                  Otherwise, move the stuff to be outdented outside the
                  indenting element. If there are any intervening elements that
                  include stuff not to be outdented, wrap the outdented stuff
                  in copies (which can duplicate id's, etc.).

                  Chrome 12 dev
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  Go to the outermost element causing indentation (even if the
                  current element is itself causing indentation). Move the text
                  to be outdented outside that outermost element, without
                  regard to any intervening elements. Then recreate the
                  original styles on the moved text, in some fashion. Something
                  like that; it confuses me and doesn't seem to be reasonable.

                  Like Firefox, except it goes to the outermost element, not
                  the innermost. Also seems to special-case to avoid duplicate
                  id's, and has a few other quirks.

                Overall, all flawed, so I'll make up my own, patterned after
                pushing down styles. First we search ancestors for a simple
                indentation element, which we stand a chance of completely
                removing. Failing that, we look for an indentation element
                that's not simple, so we can't completely remove it.

            This is the action for <a href="#the-insertorderedlist-command">the

            "#the-insertunorderedlist-command">the <code title=

            except for which list type they target. It does several things that
            vary contextually.
          </p>
          <p>
            If everything in the selection is contained in the target list type
            already, this more or less just outdents everything one step. This
            is relatively simple.

          <p>
            Otherwise, it's slightly more complicated:
          </p>
          <p>
            First, any lists of the opposite list type (<var title="">other tag
            name</var>) get converted to the target list type (<var title=
            "">tag name</var>). They get merged into a sibling if appropriate,
            otherwise we <a href="#set-the-tag-name">set the tag name</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we go through all the affected nodes, handling each run of
            consecutive siblings separately. Any line that's not already
            wrapped in an <code title="">&lt;li&gt;</code> gets wrapped. If the
            parent at this point isn't a list at all, the run gets wrapped in a
            list. If it's the wrong type of list, we <a href=
            "#split-the-parent">split the parent</a> and rewrap it in the right
            type of list. That's basically it, except that we have to exercise
            the usual care to try merging with siblings and so forth.

            Research for insertOrderedList/insertUnorderedList: tested the
            following command sequences in IE9, Firefox 4.0, Chrome 12 dev,
            Opera 11.10, OpenOffice.org 3.2.1 Ubuntu package, Microsoft Office
            Word 2007. The commands "ol", "ul", "indent", "outdent" correspond
            in browsers to "insertOrderedList", "insertUnorderedList",
            "indent", and "outdent"; in OO.org to "Numbering On/Off", "Bullets
            On/Off", "Increase Indent", "Decrease Indent"; and in Word to

            oddly, and I assume they're not really meant to be used inside
            lists. Thus I also tested with "Promote One Level" and "Demote One
            Level". These are denoted by OO' instead of OO.

            Assume that there are style rules in effect like
          </p>
          <pre>
ol ol { list-style-type: lower-alpha }
ol ol ol { list-style-type: lower-roman }
</pre>
          <p>
            This is the default appearance in Word, and I set OO to something
            similar with Bullets and Numbering → Outline in the list editing
            toolbox. I'm ignoring bullet style throughout, for no particular
            reason.

          <p>
            Ignoring the conceptual model of HTML, which users won't
            understand, here's the conceptual model I've developed for lists:
            text is divided up into blocks. Each block has an indentation level
            and a list marker type. The list marker type can be either nothing,
            ordered, or unordered. A list block cannot have indentation level
            less than one. Any given piece of text is part of only one block. A
            block may be visually non-contiguous, such as if a single list
            block is interrupted by a further-indented block.
          </p>
          <p>
            To find the right number (or letter) for an ordered-list block,
            look at the immediately preceding block, but skip over any blocks
            of higher indentation level. If there is no immediately preceding
            block, or it's not an ordered-list block, or it has a lower
            indentation level, the number is 1 (or a, i, etc.). Otherwise, it's
            the number of the preceding block plus one.
          </p>
          <p>
            ol/ul commands change the selected block to that list marker type,
            or remove the list marker type if it's already the chosen type. If
            the block has indentation level zero, it increases to one.
          </p>
          <p>
            indent/outdent commands change the selected block's indentation
            level. If a list block's indentation level is reduced to zero, it's
            converted to a regular block.
          </p>
          <p>
            What this means from an HTML perspective, roughly:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A list block is the entire contents of an &lt;li&gt; element,
            ignoring any nested list elements or indentation elements. A
            non-list block is a line box.
            </li>
            <li>Indentation level is equal to the number of ancestor elements
            that are either &lt;li&gt;s or indentation elements (blockquotes or
            indenting divs).
            </li>
            <li>To find the list marker type, go to the first ancestor that's
            either an &lt;li&gt; or indentation element.
            </li>
            <li>Correct numbering should automatically follow from the way
            &lt;ol&gt; works in HTML (which is one of the reasons I use this
            model).
            </li>
            <li>An ol command in an ordered-list block removes the surrounding
            &lt;li&gt;, migrating its contents into the parent of the
            &lt;ol&gt;. This splits up the &lt;ol&gt; if it's not the first or
            last child, and wraps the contents in a new &lt;li&gt; if
            necessary. If there's another list or indentation element nested in
            the &lt;li&gt; we're removing, it will get re-wrapped in a new
            &lt;ol&gt;, outside the newly-created &lt;li&gt;, so that it
            maintains its indentation. This might cause the new &lt;li&gt; to
            wind up in multiple pieces, if the original block was not
            contiguous, which means the non-contiguous block is split into
            several blocks (with different numbers).
            </li>
            <li>An ol command in an unordered-list block breaks up the parent
            &lt;ul&gt; and puts a new &lt;ol&gt; in between the two pieces,
            moving the parent &lt;li&gt; into it. If the &lt;li&gt; was the
            first or last child, we merge with an existing adjacent &lt;ol&gt;
            if possible. All children stay as they are.
            </li>
            <li>An ol command in a non-list block with indentation zero wraps
            it in a new &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;, or merges with an adjacent
            &lt;ol&gt; if possible.
            </li>
            <li>An ol command in a non-list block with nonzero indentation
            converts the parent to an &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;, breaking it up if
            necessary.
            </li>
            <li>The ul command works similarly to ol.
            </li>
            <li>indent in a non-list block wraps in an indentation element. In
            a list block, it wraps the &lt;li&gt; in an extra &lt;ol&gt; or
            &lt;ul&gt; as appropriate. With merging. Whatever. Let me just
            write the spec.
            </li>
            <li>outdent in a non-list block strips an indentation element, if
            one is present. In a list block, it breaks apart the parent
            &lt;ol&gt; or &lt;ul&gt; and makes the affected block a sibling in
            between the newly-split list elements. Will create new &lt;li&gt;s,
            etc. etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Sheesh, lists are complicated.

        <div class="note">
          <p>
            There are two basic ways this works in browsers: using the align
            attribute, and using CSS text-align. IE9 and Opera 11.11 use only
            the align attribute, Chrome 13 dev uses only text-align, and
            Firefox 5.0a2 varies based on styleWithCSS. The two ways produce
            entirely different results, which is a real problem, so I don't
            think Firefox's approach is tenable. text-align is more valid, and
            for typical contenteditable cases it works the same. But for cases
            where you have fixed-width blocks, like tables or just divs with a
            width set, it behaves differently, and in those cases the align
            attribute is more useful.
          </p>
          <p>
            TODO: text-align doesn't behave as expected if there are descendant
            blocks with non-100% width, like tables. The align attribute
            behaves a lot more nicely in such cases, but it's not valid. Not
            clear what to do. For now I've stuck with text-align, just because
            the cases where it misbehaves can't be created by any sequence of
            stock execCommand()s that I know of, but this needs more careful
            consideration. Gecko in CSS mode seems to special-case tables,
            adding auto margins to the table element to get it to align
            correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            TODO: We could do something along the lines of pushing down values
            here, although no browser does. In fact, it's very likely this can
            be rewritten in terms of the inline formatting command primitives,
            but it's not clear if it would be worth the added complexity.

              IE9 and LibreOffice 3.3.4 both have a whitelist of URL schemes.
              That would be complicated and involve political decisions, so
              instead, we'll just accept anything that looks like a
              hierarchical URL scheme. Google Docs is similar (as of November
              9, 2011), but it's too lax, and allows characters in the scheme
              that can't be in a scheme. For non-hierarchical schemes, we just
              whitelist mailto:, since it's the only common one that makes
              sense to autolink.

                characters from both URLs and e-mails. A trailing <code title=
                "">"</code> or <code title="">&gt;</code> will prevent
                autolinking, and a trailing <code title="">$%'/\</code> is
                included in the link.
              </p>
              <p>
                LibreOffice 3.3.4 excludes trailing <code title=

                autolinking on <code title="">$%&amp;-@</code>. It includes a
                trailing <code title="">/</code> in URLs, but it inhibits
                linking for e-mails.
              </p>
              <p>
                Google Docs (as of November 9, 2011) is complicated. Trailing
                <code title="">”’,-.</code> always prevents autolinking of a
                URL, and trailing <code title="">#%/?_</code> is always
                included in a URL. Trailing <code title=
                "">!&amp;=$()*+:;&lt;&gt;@[\]^`{|}~</code> prevent autolinking
                if there's no <code title="">?</code> before them, but are
                included in the URL if there is a <code title="">?</code>. For
                e-mails, <code title="">_</code> is included, and everything
                else prevents autolinking.
              </p>
              <p>
                None of these behaviors makes maximal sense. We should exclude
                characters if they're more likely as delimiters than actual
                trailing characters; include them if they're more likely as
                actual trailing characters; and prevent autolinking if their
                presence suggests that we're not actually looking at a link or
                e-mail address. The lists I made up for URLs are: exclude
                trailing <code title="">!"'(),-.:;&lt;&gt;[]`{}</code>, include
                anything else. For e-mail, exclude anything at all.

            This is the same as hitting backspace (see <a href=
            "#additional-requirements">Additional requirements</a>). The easy
            part is if the selection isn't collapsed: just <a href=
            "#delete-the-selection">delete the selection</a>. But it turns out
            rich-text editors have a lot of special behaviors for hitting
            backspace with a collapsed selection. Most obviously, if there's a
            text node right before the cursor (maybe wrapped in some inline
            elements), we delete its last character. But some of the special
            cases we run into are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="#invisible">Invisible</a> nodes are removed before
              anything else happens.
            </li>
            <li>An <code title="">&lt;a&gt;</code> gets removed if you
            backspace while the cursor is right after it, so the link
            disappears.
            </li>
            <li>A <code title="">&lt;br&gt;</code> or <code title=
            "">&lt;hr&gt;</code> or <code title="">&lt;img&gt;</code> gets
            deleted.
            </li>
            <li>Backspacing at the start of most blocks merges with the
            previous block. (Visually, this is a matter of deleting a line
            break.)
            </li>
            <li>Backspacing at the start of an <a href="#indentation-element">
              indentation element</a>, or an <code title="">&lt;li&gt;</code>
              or <code title="">&lt;dt&gt;</code> or <code title=
              "">&lt;dd&gt;</code> that's at the beginning of a list, outdents
              the current block (rather than merging with the previous block).
            </li>
            <li>Backspacing at the start of a table cell does nothing.
            </li>
            <li>Backspacing immediately after a table selects the table, so a
            second backspace deletes it.
            </li>
            <li>Backspacing at the start of a list item that's not at the
            beginning of a list merges with the previous list item, but keeps
            the contents on a separate line, so you have to hit backspace a
            second time to get them on the same line.

          For all the deletions here, Firefox 7.0a2 will remove wrapper
          elements like &lt;b&gt; only if they're selected, like
          {&lt;b&gt;foo&lt;/b&gt;}. IE9, Chrome 14 dev, and Opera 11.50 will
          all remove them even if only their contents are selected, like
          &lt;b&gt;[foo]&lt;/b&gt;. Gecko's behavior in the latter case leaves
          things like &lt;b&gt;{}&lt;/b&gt; in the DOM, which is unhelpful, so

                  If there's an invisible node somewhere, Firefox 5.0a2 removes
                  that node and then stops, so each backspace removes one
                  invisible node. All others remove the invisible node and then
                  continue on looking for something visible to remove. The spec
                  follows the latter behavior, since it makes more sense to the
                  user. Of course, the definition of "invisible node" is not

                  <var title="">offset</var> is zero and node is a block node.
                  Then we'll usually merge with the previous block if one
                  exists.

                <li>

                  "">node</var> does not have a child with index <var title=
                  "">offset</var> − 1. The only way this is possible is if node
                  has a length greater than zero but no children, which implies
                  it's a text or comment or PI. Comments and PIs are invisible
                  nodes, so it must be a text node. We delete the previous
                  character.

                  "">offset</var> − 1 is a block node or a br or an img. Then
                  we'll usually merge the <var title="">offset</var>th child of
                  <var title="">node</var> with the last descendant of the

                Unlike forwardDelete, there's no special case for diacritics.
                This means backspacing will just delete the last combining
                diacritic typed, or the whole character if it's precomposed.
                This matches everything I tested (IE9, Firefox 7.0a2, Chrome 14

                If you try backspacing out of a list item, merge it with the
                previous item, but add a line break. Then you have to backspace
                again if you really want them to be on the same line. This
                matches Word 2007 and OpenOffice.org 3.2.1 Ubuntu, and also
                matches "behavior when typing in contentEditable elements", but
                does not match any browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that this behavior is quite different from what happens if
                you actually select the linebreak in between the two lines. In
                that case, the blocks are merged as normal.

              <p>
                Also note that hitting backspace twice will merge with the
                previous item. This matches OO.org, but Word will outdent the
                item on subsequent backspaces. Word's behavior doesn't fit well
                with the way lists work in HTML, and we probably don't want it.

          <p>
            Tested browser versions: IE9, Firefox 4.0, Chrome 13 dev, Opera
            11.10.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firefox and Chrome will replace a &lt;blockquote&gt; by a &lt;p&gt;
            or other given tag. IE and Opera will nest the &lt;p&gt; inside
            instead. The latter makes more sense, given that a) we don't
            support formatBlock with &lt;blockquote&gt; and b)
            &lt;blockquote&gt;s are logically different, since they can contain
            many lines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firefox will not convert other tags like &lt;p&gt; to &lt;div&gt;,
            it will only wrap unwrapped lines in a &lt;div&gt;. Firefox also
            won't replace &lt;div&gt; by things like &lt;p&gt;, it will nest
            the &lt;p&gt; inside. The spec follows other browsers.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you try to convert a &lt;dt&gt; to a &lt;div&gt; or &lt;p&gt; or
            such, Firefox breaks out of the &lt;dl&gt; entirely, leaving
            ...&lt;dt&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;. Chrome will convert
            a &lt;dt&gt; or &lt;dd&gt; to the given element, leaving a
            &lt;div&gt; or &lt;p&gt; or such as the child of a &lt;dl&gt;. I
            follow IE/Opera, which only affect the contents of
            &lt;dt&gt;/&lt;dd&gt; (Firefox behaves this way for &lt;dd&gt; as
            well, just not &lt;dt&gt;). This means you can get invalid DOMs
            like &lt;dt&gt;&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;p&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;, but they can be
            serialized as text/html, so I'm not too fussy.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to &lt;li&gt;, IE/Opera behave like with
            &lt;dt&gt;/&lt;dd&gt;, which is how I behave too. Firefox
            apparently refuses to do anything. Chrome tries to wrap the parent
            list element, breaking it up if only some of the children are
            selected; this produces unserializable DOMs if you're wrapping with
            &lt;p&gt;.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you're converting multiple blocks at once, Chrome replaces
            them all by one block with &lt;br&gt; stuck in, like
            &lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;bar&lt;/p&gt; -&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;foo&lt;br&gt;bar&lt;/div&gt;. It wipes out intervening
            block containers too in some cases. This might make sense for
            &lt;address&gt;/&lt;h*&gt;/&lt;pre&gt;, but other browsers don't do
            it.

              This tries to avoid misnesting if only some lines of an element

              such. It tries to heuristically distinguish between divs used as
              line-breakers and divs used as actual wrappers by checking if
              they have prohibited paragraph children as descendants. It works
              for address too, in case there are paragraphs nested inside. Thus
              &lt;address&gt;[foo]&lt;br&gt;bar&lt;/address&gt; becomes

                This is unreasonable, because the two possible inputs here look
                identical to the user and might have been produced by identical
                user input.

                (modulo oddities in its handling of divs). Opera 11.10 is
                similar, except it leaves a trailing &lt;br&gt; in the first
                element.

                The specced behavior is a compromise between the existing
                behaviors, predicated on the fact that
                &lt;h1&gt;foo&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h1&gt;bar&lt;/h1&gt; almost never
                makes sense, and &lt;p&gt;foo&lt;br&gt;bar&lt;/p&gt; isn't
                usually what's wanted either.

                        (It uses nbsp instead of &lt;br&gt; to make blocks not
                        collapse, so the equivalent for us would be to insert a

                        doesn't format it. I follow Firefox/Opera just because
                        it's the simplest given how I happen to have written
                        the spec, and it's a corner case, so exact behavior

                        normal. Chrome 14 dev and Opera 11.50 leave it alone
                        and don't format it. I go with the majority, which is
                        again simpler to spec.

            IE9 returns human-readable strings like "Normal" (p/div/etc.),

            address, h*, p, and pre. Chrome 14 dev recognizes address, div, h*,

            and section. I'll go with everything that

          comments. The one special case you get when deleting forward but not
          backward is that if the cursor is before a grapheme cluster that
          consists of multiple characters, like a base character with combining
          diacritics, we delete the diacritics too. (Backspacing just deletes
          the last diacritic, so you have to backspace several times to remove
          the whole cluster.)

                    Firefox 7.0a2, Chrome 14 dev, Word 2007, and OpenOffice.org
                    3.2.1 Ubuntu act as the spec says, getting rid of all
                    diacritics on forward delete. IE9 and Opera 11.50 have no
                    special case and just delete the next character. I go with
                    Firefox/Chrome/Word/OO.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, when I actually type in the text box as opposed to
                    running semi-automated tests, IE9 has magical behavior: it
                    replaces the base character with something that looks like
                    ◌ U+25CC DOTTED CIRCLE. Further strikes of the delete key
                    remove the diacritics, and the circle vanishes along with
                    the last of them. I wasn't able to get it to actually
                    replace the base character, so I'm not sure what the point
                    is. The circle doesn't seem to appear in the DOM, and
                    apparently it disappears in some circumstances. This might
                    be worth standardizing somehow, I don't know.

                  <p>
                    TODO: The way we remove diacritics is probably not right.
                    We probably want to normalize to grapheme cluster
                    boundaries, using UAX#29 or something. We also need to
                    handle non-BMP stuff. The idea is that if the cursor is
                    before a character that precedes a combining mark, you need
                    to delete the combining mark too.

              Outputs &lt;blockquote style="margin-right: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;,
              or when surrounding RTL blocks, &lt;blockquote
              style="margin-left: 0px" dir="rtl"&gt;. The direction seems to go
              by the end of the selection. The presence of the dir attribute
              means that any contents that were inheriting a different dir from
              an ancestor get their direction changed as a side effect, but if
              they actually have the opposite dir specified, they won't appear
              to be indented. It doesn't reset top or bottom margins on the
              blockquote, so it adds them. If it's not wrapping a block
              element, like if it's only wrapping up until a &lt;br&gt;, it
              adds a &lt;p&gt;.

              In styleWithCSS mode, adds style="margin-left: 40px" to the
              appropriate block container (or margin-right if it's RTL). If
              there's no appropriate block container, adds a div. If multiple
              blocks are affected, it goes by the direction of the block whose
              style it's changing, which winds up being wrong for descendants
              with different direction. In non-styleWithCSS mode, uses
              &lt;blockquote&gt;, so it indents on both sides and also adds
              top/bottom margins.

              style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px"&gt; in
              both modes for both LTR and RTL (which is broken for RTL, since
              it indents only on the left).

              Outputs &lt;blockquote&gt;, so it indents on both sides and on
              the top/bottom.

          </dl>
          <p>
            For repeated indentation, everyone except Opera that outputs
            &lt;blockquote&gt;s just puts them at the outermost possible
            location, which works well. Opera puts them in the innermost
            position, which is broken, because it will even put them inside
            &lt;p&gt; (which will not round-trip through text/html
            serialization).
          </p>
          <p>
            Gecko in CSS mode messes up by adding margins even to things like
            &lt;blockquote&gt; that already have margins from CSS rules,
            instead of nesting a div, so it doesn't actually increase the
            indentation. However, if an element has an explicit left margin
            (assuming LTR), it will increase the margin to 80px, so it works
            with WebKit's blockquotes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have two strategies for handling directionality: always indent
            on both sides (Firefox non-CSS, Opera) or try to figure out
            heuristically which side we want (IE, Firefox CSS). The latter
            approach is only possible by adding extra markup and complexity, so
            for now we'll take the easy way out and go with just indenting on
            both sides.
          </p>

            This reasoning doesn't discuss lists. For research on lists, see
            the comment for <a href=
            "#the-insertorderedlist-command">insertOrderedList</a>. List
            handling is more complicated and I wound up differing from all
            browsers in lots of ways.

          You'd think interop here would be simple, right? Nope: we have three
          different behaviors across four browsers. Opera 11.00 is the only one
          that acts more or less like the spec. IE9 and Chrome 12 dev treat the
          value as an id, which is weird and probably useless, so I don't do
          it. Firefox 4.0 produces &lt;hr size=2 width=100%&gt; instead of
          &lt;hr&gt;, which is also weird and almost definitely useless, so I
          don't do it. Then you have the varying behavior in splitting up

              Will allow &lt;dt&gt; inside &lt;dt&gt; (doesn't serialize). If
              you try inserting dir/ol/ul inside an existing dir/ol/ul, it will
              strip the list element and leave only the li's, so inserting
              &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;abc&lt;/ul&gt; into
              &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;f[o]o&lt;/ol&gt; creates

              &lt;dt&gt;/&lt;dd&gt;/&lt;li&gt; that don't descend from a list
              will be left alone, not converted to &lt;p&gt;. Empty elements
              seem not to be inserted. &lt;li&gt; will get put inside
              &lt;p&gt;, which breaks serialization. Nothing is allowed inside

              remove the child &lt;p&gt;, adding its contents to the parent

              Interestingly, most of the places where it's non-serializable per

            IE9 is tripped up by &lt;xmp&gt;, and also often doesn't add an
            extra &lt;br&gt; when the one it just inserted is extraneous.

            Firefox 6.0a2 doesn't notice if you're trying to put the &lt;br&gt;
            in a bad place, which can result in unserializable DOMs.

            Chrome 14 dev inserts a literal linebreak for pre and xmp and maybe
            other similar elements. This doesn't seem very useful, so I don't
            bother.

            Opera 11.11 isn't heedful of &lt;xmp&gt;, and treats &lt;pre&gt;
            somewhat oddly.

            This is the same as hitting enter (see <a href=
            "#additional-requirements">Additional requirements</a>). The
            general rule is that we find the nearest <a href=
            "#single-line-container">single-line container</a> ancestor, clone
            it and insert the clone after it, and then move all the contents
            after the cursor (along with the cursor itself) to the clone. But
            there are a few special cases:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If we can't find a single-line container to use, first we wrap
            the current line in a new container with the <a href=
            "#default-single-line-container-name">default single-line container
            name</a>.

            <li>For <code title="">&lt;address&gt;</code>, <code title=
            "">&lt;listing&gt;</code>, and <code title="">&lt;pre&gt;</code>,
            we add a <code title="">&lt;br&gt;</code> instead of cloning it.
            These are all elements that are meant to contain multiple lines,
            not have one line per element.
            </li>
            <li>If the cursor is in a list item with no contents, hitting enter
            breaks out of the list entirely, outdenting the current item. This
            means that if you're in a list, you can hit enter twice to break
            out.
            </li>
            <li>If the cursor is at the end of a heading, hitting enter doesn't
            make a new heading, it switches to the <a href=
            "#default-single-line-container-name">default single-line container
            name</a>.
            </li>
            <li>If the cursor is at the end of a <code title=
            "">&lt;dt&gt;</code> or <code title="">&lt;dd&gt;</code>, the new
            element is the opposite type, so you naturally switch between
            entering terms and definitions.

            There are three major behaviors here. Firefox 5.0a2 behaves
            identically to execCommand("formatBlock", false, "p"), which is not
            really useful. IE9 actually just overwrites the selection with an
            empty paragraph element, which seems not very useful either. Chrome
            13 dev and Opera 11.10 behave basically the same as if the user hit
            the Return key. This latter behavior seems much more useful, even
            though it's horribly misnamed, so it's what I'll spec. Comments
            about IE/Firefox are based on manual tests, where I hit Enter
            instead of running commands.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Actually, Opera doesn't behave quite the same for insertParagraph
            and line breaks. But it's pretty close, and I expect the
            differences are bugs.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, of course, we have several flavors of line-breaking behavior
            to choose from. Firefox prefers &lt;br&gt;s, unless it's in the
            middle of a &lt;p&gt; or something. Opera and IE like &lt;p&gt;.
            Chrome prefers &lt;div&gt;. And there are lots of subtleties
            besides. I go with IE/Opera-style behavior, as discussed in
            <a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-May/031577.html">

        <div class="note">
          <p>
            This is the same as typing text (see <a href=
            "#additional-requirements">Additional requirements</a>). If the
            input string is more than one character, first we split it up into
            one execution per character, for simplicity. The general rule is
            then that we record each command's <a href="#state-override">state
            override</a> or <a href="#value-override">value override</a>,
            insert the new character and select it, restore any overrides that
            we saved, and collapse the selection to its end.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea of the override business is that the user might run a
            command like bold when the selection is collapsed. There's nothing
            to bold in that case, but if the user runs bold and then types a
            character, they expect it to be bold. Thus we save the requested
            state in an override and restore it when the user types. Deleting
            things can also set overrides, if the deleted text was styled.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whitespace is a special case. The note for <a href=
            "#canonical-space-sequences">canonical space sequences</a> gives
            some of the background. If the user tries typing a space, we make
            it non-breaking so it doesn't collapse with anything, then
            canonicalize whitespace around the insertion point so line breaking
            isn't adversely affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            One last special case is a newline. For that we just pass off to
            <a href="#the-insertparagraph-command">the <code title=
            "">insertParagraph</code> command</a>.

            TODO: This doesn't work well if the input contains things that
            aren't supposed to appear in HTML, like carriage returns or nulls.
            Nor is it going to work well if the current cursor position is in
            between two halves of a non-BMP character. This will result in
            unserializability. The current spec disregards this, as Chrome 14
            dev does. (It's not relevant to other browsers, since they don't
            support this as a command.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Important issue: non-breaking space fun! The issue: if the user
            hits space twice, they expect it to create two spaces, not
            collapse. Also, if they're at the beginning or end of a line and
            hit space, again, they expect it not to collapse. Since we don't
            want to require that all contenteditable element contents always be
            used only with white-space: pre-wrap, we need to convert to and
            from non-breaking spaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there's a catch: you can't just make spaces non-breaking
            willy-nilly, because that doesn't just stop the space from
            collapsing, it also prevents breaking. (Chrome 14 dev actually
            cheats here: in contenteditable, it doesn't collapse nbsp, but
            breaks after it like a regular space.) The upshot of this is that
            any nbsp needs to be followed by a space, or else it might end up
            at the beginning of a line and be visible there; and it needs to be
            preceded by a space, or else it might break a line prematurely. How
            to achieve both of these goals when there are an even number of
            spaces to display is left as an exercise for the reader.
          </p>
          <p>
            Browsers vary greatly in how they handle all this, of course!
          </p>
          <p>
            The basic philosophy of IE9 is that if you're inserting a space,
            and one or both of the neighboring characters is a space, change
            the neighboring characters to non-breaking spaces. This breaks if
            one of the neighboring characters is part of a run of collapsed
            whitespace: "foo []bar" becomes "foo &amp;nbsp; []bar", which
            converts one visible space to three.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firefox 6.0a2 will sometimes convert the space you're inserting to
            an nbsp, sometimes convert neighboring spaces to nbsps, and
            sometimes convert neighboring nbsps to spaces. I cannot discern any
            clear reason to when it chooses what, except that it seems to
            prefer runs of nbsp's followed by a single space (although not
            always). I didn't find any outright bugs, except the inevitable
            ones like nbsp's sometimes being right after letters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chrome 14 dev tries to normalize everything to look like "
            &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ...", alternating with space then nbsp.
            Unfortunately, it does so buggily, because it converts collapsed
            spaces to nbsp's, so inserting a space before " " makes it into "
            &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;", which changes one visible space to four (or
            arbitrarily many).
          </p>
          <p>
            Opera 11.11 has varying behavior, like Firefox and Chrome. Like
            Firefox, I didn't discern an obvious pattern.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was all <a href=
            "http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-June/032187.html">
            discussed</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, we're stuck with this nbsp stuff, because of 1)
            legacy reasons, 2) mail clients might not support CSS equivalents,
            3) authors might not know to apply any CSS to wherever the content
            is eventually used. The behavior I decided on to minimize the evil
            is as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the first and last spaces are in non-collapsing positions,
            two spaces is nbsp+space, three is space+nbsp+space, four or more
            is space+nbsp followed by the pattern for two less.
            </li>
            <li>If the first space has to be an nbsp so it doesn't collapse,
            three is instead nbsp+nbsp+space, four or more is nbsp+space
            followed by the pattern for two less.
            </li>
            <li>If the last space has to be nbsp, two is space+nbsp, three is
            space+nbsp+nbsp, four or more is space+nbsp followed by the pattern
            for two less.
            </li>
            <li>If the first and last space must both be nbsp, two is
            nbsp+nbsp, three is nbsp+space+nbsp, four or more nbsp+space
            followed by the pattern for two less.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This avoids nbsp at the end of a run except where it's needed, so
            words won't appear indented if they wrap to the next line. It
            avoids more than two nbsp's in a row, so there won't be huge chunks
            of space that get wrapped all at once. And it avoids nbsp at the
            beginning of a run except where it's needed or if there are only
            two spaces in the run, so words won't have to wrap unnecessarily.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is still a huge headache, though.

                Chrome 14 dev does the deletion even if the value is empty. Of
                course, other browsers don't expose this as an execCommand(),
                so no one else has any defined behavior in this case at all, so
                I follow Chrome.
              </p>
              <p>
                IE9, Firefox 7.0a2, Chrome 14 dev, and Opera 11.50 all don't
                strip wrappers, except that as usual, Gecko does if you select
                the whole wrapper, like {&lt;b&gt;foo&lt;/b&gt;}. Also, Chrome
                14 dev seems to strip the wrapper and try recreating the style
                in cases like &lt;b&gt;[foo&lt;/b&gt;bar], where it starts in a
                wrapper but ends after it; this doesn't always work so well, so
                I don't do it. Firefox 7.0a2 also has the deletion set
                overrides for indeterminate state commands, so if you run
                insertText on [foo&lt;b&gt;bar&lt;/b&gt;baz] it will make the
                result bold.
              </p>
              <p>
                These things don't make any sense to me, so I don't do them. I
                set overrides based on the first editable text node in the
                range when deleting; preserve any wrappers at the start of the
                range; and restore the overrides in case preserving the
                wrappers isn't enough (like if they weren't set by deletion at
                all). This behavior seems to closely match IE9.

            As a general rule, ignoring nodes with children saves us from
            treating &lt;div align=left&gt;&lt;div
            align=center&gt;foo&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; as though it's

            nodes, instead, or something like that. At any rate, it fails on
            images. Firefox 6.0a2 (for state and value) gets tripped up by
            examples like the one given.
          </p>
          <p>

            IE9 throws exceptions in almost every case when querying the state
            of justify*, and Opera 11.11 returns false in every case except
            some seemingly random crazy ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firefox 6.0a2 returns true for the state of justify* if anything in
            the range has the right alignment, not if everything does. This
            isn't consistent with how state works for the inline commands, nor
            with WebKit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chrome 14 dev counts text-align on inline elements, which is wrong,
            because the property has no effect. It also counts it on
            non-editable elements, which is wrong, because then the state for
            justify* wouldn't necessarily be true after executing it. (Chrome
            actually does align the non-editable elements, but that's just a
            bug.) Chrome further returns false for justify* if the
            justification is just the default inherited justification, e.g.,
            left for LTR. This doesn't seem to make sense either.
          </p>
          <p>
            State is kind of redundant here, because it's true if and only if
            indeterminate is false and the value is equal to the desired value.
            However, I'll support it anyway, since Gecko/WebKit do.

          Not bidi-safe, but it's a pretty marginal corner case where it fails.
          Firefox 6.0a2 behaves weirdly here: it keys off the start node of the

          false, which would suggest that the whole selection is aligned left,

                This step is kind of weird. For regular outdenting, we start at
                the inside and outdent going out, so that we remove the
                innermost indentation, on the theory that that will produce the
                cleanest markup (remove the most nodes). For lists, we remove
                the outermost indentation, because it makes a difference
                whether we remove inner or outer indentation, and logically we
                want to remove outer. E.g.,
              </p>
              <pre>
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;foo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;bar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
</pre>
              <p>
                should become
              </p>
              <pre>
foo&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;bar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

        <p>
          These are the steps to follow when triggering copy actions through
          the document.execCommand() API:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Set the action's <em>script-triggered</em> flag.

          set the action's <em>script-may-access-clipboard</em> flag, otherwise

          </li>
          <li>Dispatch the copy event synchronously.
          </li>
          <li>If the copy event is not canceled, execute the copy action
          synchronously.

        <p class="note">
          Copy commands triggered from document.execCommand() will only affect
          the contents of the real clipboard if the event is dispatched from an
          event that is trusted and triggered by the user, or if the
          implementation is configured to allow this. How implementations can
          be configured to allow write access to the clipboard is outside the

              A bit confusing. The gist seems to be that it does
              selectAllChildren() on the body, except sometimes it doesn't.

            <dd>
              Throws an exception if nothing in the document is editable, which
              apparently it always does for execCommand(). If there's a body,
              it does selectAllChildren() on that, and otherwise it does
              selectAllChildren() on the root element. If there's no root
              element, throws an exception.

              If there's no root element, removes the selection. If there's a
              root element but no body, collapses the selection at (document,
              0). If there's a body, it selects all the contents of the body,
              although that doesn't mean the resulting anchor or focus actually
              are the body node (they're usually text nodes). But it seems to
              *avoid* selecting contenteditable stuff: if all the visible
              things in the body are contenteditable, it removes all ranges
              from the selection, and if some are, it freaks out and behaves
              oddly. But designMode doesn't trouble it.

          <p>
            IE9 and Opera 11.00 don't support this command. By and large, they
            act the way Gecko and WebKit do when styleWithCSS is off. Gecko
            invented it, and WebKit also <a href=
            "https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13490">supports</a> it.
            The default in Firefox 4.0 is off, while all other browsers behave
            like the default is on (and IE/Opera give no way to turn it off),
            so I default it to on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Handling of <var title="">value</var> matches Firefox 5.0a2. Chrome
            13 dev treats the case-sensitive string "true" as true, the
            case-sensitive string "false" as false, and does nothing for any
            other string. I went with Gecko because this way there are only two
            possible effects, not three, which makes it easier to reason about
            and debug. Also, Gecko made up the command, so this is probably
            more web-compatible. Cursory searches of Google Code and GitHub
            suggest that authors almost always pass a boolean as the third
            argument when using styleWithCSS, in which case the two behaviors
            work the same.
