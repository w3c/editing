        <p class="warning">This spec is incomplete and it is not expected that it
        will advance beyond draft status. Authors should not use most of these
        features directly, but instead use JavaScript editing libraries.  The features
        described in this document are not implemented consistently or fully by user
        agents, and it is not expected that this will change in the foreseeable future.
        There is currently no alternative to some execCommand actions related to
        clipboard content and contentEditable=true is often used to draw the caret
        and move the caret in the block direction as well as a few minor subpoints.
        This spec is to mean to help implementations in standardizing these
        existing features.
        It is predicted that in the future both specs will be replaced
        by <a href="https://w3c.github.io/contentEditable/">Content Editable</a>
        and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/input-events/">Input Events</a>.</p>
        <p class="issue">We need to figure out whether we want to continue working
          on this document or not. If we keep the current division between execCommand
          and contentEditable=True, we should likely move those things that are
          only contentEditable related from the <a href="../execCommand/">execCommand
          spec</a> to this document. For example, some of the text concerning
          <a href="../execCommand/#deleting-the-selection">deletion of content</a> may
          be more related to contentEditable = True.</p>

        This specification defines the expected behaviors for for elements with the contenteditable attribute set to <code>true</code> or <code>plaintext-only</code>.
       This specification builds on HTML5.

        <h2>contenteditable="true"</h2>
        <p><i>This section is not normative.</i></p>
        <p>ContentEditable elements provide a caret that can be moved with the caret, and allow for the direction insertion of text at the position of the caret via the keyboard.</p>
        <p>ContentEditable elements can function as editing hosts for commands executed with <code><a href="../execCommand/">execCommand</a></code>.
