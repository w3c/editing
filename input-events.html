        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>This document describes editing related additions to 2 events - Input
          and beforeinput which are described in the
          <a href="https://w3c.github.io/uievents/">UI events spec</a>. The goal
          of these events is to allow authors to understand and/or override
          default edit behavior both before and after editing occurs.</p>

        <h2>Problems solved</h2>
        <p><i>This section is not normative.</i></p>
        <p>Creating a webbased texteditor requires a considerable amount of
        JavaScript on top of the browser code, among other things because:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Browsers do not handle all editing operations the same way.</li>
            <li>Browsers are often buggy in the way they handle certain editing
            operations.</li>
            <li>Individual sites may have custom preferences for how they want
            to handle certain editing operations.</li>
            <li>The development of hihg-level text editing features in browsers
            has not followed the principles laid out in the
            <a href="http://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">Extensible Web
            Manifesto</a> in that development of these features has not always
            been in coordination with the needs of the web developer community.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This spec seeks to alleviate the problem by providing a simple way
        for web developers to both override browser handeling of all user input
        related to text editing through the <a>beforeinput</a> event, and to
        monitor what browsers have changed in the DOM due to user input trough
        the <a>input</a> event.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Use cases</h2>
        <p><i>This section is not normative.</i></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Creating a JavaScript text editor in which the &lt;strong&gt;-tag
            is used instead of the &lt;b&gt;-tag to mark text that the user marks
            as bold, using any browser-builtin way to mark a text as bold,
            without having access to all existing browsers.</li>
            <li>Creating a JavaScript text editor which works with a data model
            in the background where JavaScript takes care of rendering changes to
            the edited text to the DOM.</li>
            <li>Creating a JavaScript editor which only allows a subset of richtext
            editing (for example: bold is allowed, but italic not).</li>
            <li>Creating a collaborative editor in which JavaScript is used to
            render changes to the DOM, based on user intentions with users using
            different browsers with different ways of expressing specific
            intentions.</li>
            <li>Creating a JavaScript editor with different user access options,
            where some users only can add or delete text and other users only can
            add or remove certain types of formatting.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Input Event Types</h3>

        <p>Input events are sent before (beforeinput event) and after

                a change of the DOM, it MUST trigger the corresponding <code>beforeinput</code>
