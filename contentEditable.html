        <h2>Problems solved</h2>
        <p><i>This section is not normative.</i></p>
        <p>Creating a webbased texteditor requires a considerable amount of
        JavaScript on top of the browser code, among other things because:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Browsers do not handle all editing operations the same way.</li>
            <li>Browsers are often buggy in the way they handle certain editing
            operations.</li>
            <li>Individual sites may have custom preferences for how they want
            to handle certain editing operations.</li>
            <li>The development of high-level text editing features in browsers
            has not followed the principles laid out in the
            <a href="http://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">Extensible Web
            Manifesto</a> in that development of these features has not always
            been in coordination with the needs of the web developer community.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This spec seeks to alleviate the problem by providing a simple way
        for web developers prevent all browser default handling of editing
        operations at different levels without having to preventDefault each of
        them.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Use cases</h2>
        <p><i>This section is not normative.</i></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Creating a JavaScript text editor in which the &lt;strong&gt;-tag
            is used instead of the &lt;b&gt;-tag to mark text that the user marks
            as bold, using any browser-builtin way to mark a text as bold,
            without having access to all existing browsers.</li>
            <li>Creating a JavaScript text editor which works with a data model
            in the background where JavaScript takes care of rendering changes to
            the edited text to the DOM.</li>
            <li>Creating a JavaScript editor which only allows a subset of richtext
            editing (for example: bold is allowed, but italic not).</li>
            <li>Creating a collaborative editor in which JavaScript is used to
            render changes to the DOM, based on user intentions with users using
            different browsers with different ways of expressing specific
            intentions.</li>
            <li>Creating a JavaScript editor with different user access options,
            where some users only can add or delete text and other users only can
            add or remove certain types of formatting.</li>
            <li>Creating a JavaScript editor in which caret movement is handled
            differently from the default.</li>
            <li>Creating a JavaScript editor with advanced elements, such as
            non-editable regions, inline SVGs, canvas-elements and other elements
            for which <code>contenteditable=true</code> currently creates caret
            placement issues in several browsers.</li>

        <h2>contenteditable</h2>
        <p>The contenteditable attribute is an enumerated attribute whose keywords
        are the empty string (""), "events", "caret", "typing", "plaintext-only",
        "true", and "false". There is one additional state, the
        <code>inherit</code> state, which is the missing value default (and the
        invalid value default).</p>

        <p>The empty string and the "true" keyword map to the <code>true</code>
        state. The other keywords map to their respective states.</p>

        <p>The <code>false</code> state indicates that the element is not editable.
        The <code>inherit</code> state indicates that the element has the state
        of its parent.
        </p>

        <p>
        The contentEditable IDL attribute, on getting, must return the string
        "true" if the content attribute is set to the <code>true</code> state,
        "plaintext-only" if the content attribute is set to the <code>plaintext-only</code> state,
        "typing" if the content attribute is set to the <code>typing</code> state,
        "caret" if the content attribute is set to the <code>caret</code> state,
        "events" if the content attribute is set to the <code>events</code> state,
        "false" if the content attribute is set to the <code>false</code> state,
        "plaintext-only" if the content attribute is set to the
        <code>plaintext-only</code> state, and <code>inherit</code> otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
        On setting, if the new value is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the
        string "inherit" then the content attribute must be removed, if the new
        value is an ASCII case-insensitive match for a string matching the name
        of a state, then the content attribute must be set to the name of that
        state, and otherwise the attribute setter must throw a SyntaxError
        exception.</p>
        <p>
        The isContentEditable IDL attribute, on getting, must return true if the
        element is either an editing host or editable, and false otherwise.

    <section>
      <h2>Meaning of states</h2>

      <p>The states "events", "caret", "typing", "plaintext-only" and "true" are
      hierarchically ordered, so that the state "caret" also includes the features
      of the "events" state, the "typing" state includes the features of the "caret"
      state, the "plaintext-only" state includes the features of the "typing" state,
      and the "true" state includes all the features of the "plaintext-only" state.</p>

      <p>The "events" state means that beforeinput events are triggered when the
      user asks for an editing operation. The "caret" state adds
      default browser controlled movement of the caret. The "typing" state adds
      handling of text input through IME and keyboard, and
      deletion within an IME composition. The "plaintext-only" state adds handling
      of text deletion within a text node. The "true" state adds handling of
      deletion deletion of non-textual content and editing commands through the
      execCommand command.</p>

      <p>The states "events", "caret", "typing" and "plaintext-only" are defined
      in this document.</p>

      <p>The state "true" is currently not well-defined and its usage is
      discouraged. An initial attempt has been made to specify the behavior of
      the "true" state in the
      <a href="contentEditableTrue.html">contentEditable=True spec</a>.</p>

      <section>
        <h3 id="events-state">contentEditable=events state</h2>

        <p>In a focused <a>editing host</a> that is in the "events" state, a caret
        MUST be drawn if the selection is collapsed, and it MUST be possible to
        place the caret in all of the <a>Legal Caret Positions</a>
        programmatically.</p>

        <p>All user editing intentions initiated while an <a>editing host</a>
        that is in the events state is focused, MUST trigger a `beforeinput`
        event.</p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="caret-state">contentEditable=caret state</h2>

        <p>A focused <a>editing host</a> that is in the "caret" state MUST behave
        like an <a>editing host</a> in the events state. Additionally, the
        default action of the `beforeSelectionChange` event in such an
        <a>editing host</a> must be to move the caret in the indicated
        direction, if movement in that direction seems possible.</p>

        <p class="note">Notice the planned
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/selection-api/issues/56">beforeSelectionChange</a>
        event.</p>

      <section>
        <h3 id="caret-state">contentEditable=typing state</h2>

        <p>A focused <a>editing host</a> that is in the "typing" state MUST behave
        like an <a>editing host</a> in the caret state, and additionally, it
        MUST handle text insertion by keyboard at the position of the caret if
        the caret is placed within a text node or it is possible to place a text
        node at the place of the caret. It must by default also handle
        composition by IME, both insertion as well as deletion of text input.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="caret-state">contentEditable=plaintext-only state</h2>

        <p>A focused <a>editing host</a> that is in the "plaintext-only" state MUST
        behave like an <a>editing host</a> in the typing state, and additionally,
        it MUST handle text deletion.</p>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 id="cutting_and_pasting">Cutting and pasting</h2>

        <p>Within an <a>editing host</a> that is in the "events", "caret" or
        "typing" state, cutting and pasting is disabled. Within an <a>editing
        host</a> in the "plaintext-only" state, pasting only causes plaintext
        pasting by default. Independently of the state of the <a>editing  host</a>,
        the events `paste` and `cut` should be triggered whenever the user
        expresses the intention to paste or cut.</p>

        <section>
            <h3 id="caret_drawing">Caret drawing</h3>

            <p>A caret is drawn in any <a>editing host</a> that is focused, that
            does not hold any other selections. Under such conditions, the caret
            represents a collapsed selection.</p>

        <section>
            <h3 id="caret_positions">Caret positions</h3>

            <p>It MUST be possible to put the caret in any of the <a>Legal
            Caret Positions</a> programatically and for the caret to be visible
            in these in any <a>editing host</a> that is in the "events", "caret"

            <section>
                <h3 id="caret_movement">Caret movement</h3>

                <p>The specific location that the  caret is moved to by default
                in an <a>editing host</a> in the "caret" and "typing" state, is
                out of scope for this specification, but later versions of this
                specification or specifications covering other contentEditable
                specifications may further specify the movement patterns of the
                caret.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="replacing_text">Replacing text/content</h2>

            <p>When the user indicates the wish to replace part of the
            contents of a <a>editing host</a>, by means
            of a browser-builtin spell checker or alike, a `beforeinput` input
            with `inputType` set to `replaceText` or `replaceContent` is
            triggered. No part of the DOM is being changed by default in an
            editing host that is in the "events", "caret" or "typing" state.</p>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h2 id="removal">Removal of content</h2>

            <p>Content is not removed automatically through user input in an
            <a>editing host</a> that is in the "events" or "caret" state. Instead,
            Del/Backspace key presses, etc. trigger user `beforeinput`
            events with `inputType` set to `deleteContentForward` or
            `deleteContentBackward`. The same is true for any <a>editing host</a>
            that is in the "typing" state, unless it is currently in the
            composition mode, in which case it will remove characters from the
            DOM if they are part of the composition.</p>
            <p>In the "plaintext-only" state, an <a>editing host</a> does handle
            text deletion within a single text node.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="spell_checking">Advanced grammar checking</h2>

            <p>An implementation CAN provide spell check, grammar check and
            other advanced functionality that are not defined through a
            specification for any <a>editing host</a>.
            These features MUST be disabled by default.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="context_menu">Context menu</h2>

            <p>If the implementation provides a `context menu`, this `context
            menu` SHOULD contain items for editing operations such as `paste`,
            `cut`, `copy`, `delete` and CAN contain items for spellchecking for
            any <a>editing host</a>. Triggering any of `context menu`
            items MUST NOT by default cause any change to the DOM,
            `paste`, `cut` and `beforeinput` events SHOULD be
            triggered. Menu items in a `context menu` that do not cause DOM
            changes by default SHOULD function as in any other editing
            context.</p>
